  PREFACE

I have laboured under great difficulties and many discouragements
in preparing the following pages for the press. A narrative,
having for its principal subject a journey through the interior of
China, must derive its interest either from the novelty and
importance of the incidents which it relates, or from the quantity
of original information which it contains respecting that singular
country. In both these respects I am in a great degree
anticipated. The tale of the Transactions of Lord Amherst's Embassy
has been too well and too circumstantially told by an official
pen to leave me much expectation of finding public curiosity
unsatisfied respecting them. The close delineation of that part of
the country equally visited by Lord Macartney's and Lord Amherst's
Embassy, contained in the accurate and laboured work of the late
Sir George Staunton, has left very little to tell respecting it, and the
production just alluded to has in a great measure described what
was exclusively seen by the latter. The work that had for its object
the establishing " the point of rank which China may be considered
to hold in the scale of nations," has so exhausted the topics which
in this view might be dwelt upon, and has so illustrated them by
the writings of the Missionaries, as almost to preclude the hope of
a further elucidation of the same subjects from similar sources of
information.
<!-- Leaf 16, Page: VI -->

I am in scarcely less difficulty respecting the natural history of the
countries which I have visited. Sickness abridged, and shipwreck
almost annihilated the materials which would have afforded extensive
scientific communication respecting China. My illness, indeed, was
comparatively of little importance, except as it prevented my
observation of the country; for the exertions of my friends more than
compensated the loss of my individual efforts in making collections.
But the shipwreck deprived me of all the fruits of those means
which the wisdom and liberality of the East India Company placed
at my command; and has only left me the duty of stating, in
justice to others, what was the nature of those means, and something
of the results to which they led.


My appointment to the Embassy was at first simply medical;
but through the recommendation of Sir Joseph Banks to the
East India Company, I was permitted to take upon me the office
of Naturalist, and received an ample outfit of all the apparatus
for scientific research. To give greater effect to my exertions in
collecting and preserving the vegetable productions of the
countries to be visited by the Embassy, a botanic gardener, from the
Boyal gardens at Kew, taking out with him a plant cabin, for the
preservation of living specimens, was placed under my directions;
and to assist generally in my pursuits my brother-in-law, Mr. Poole,
was allowed to attend me. With such facilities, it would have been
strange, even in countries often trod by scientific men, if I had not
gleaned some new and important facts. But in China, scarcely
touched by the foot of the naturalist, nothing short of a rich harvest
could have been received as a token of my due exertions. The
proofs of what these were, of their efficiency or abortiveness, are
buried in the straights of Gaspar. But it is incumbent on me
to bear testimony to the exertions of Mr. Hooper, the Botanic
Gardener, whose industry was equally unremitting and availing.
His more peculiar department having been to collect and preserve
seeds, he placed, on our leaving China, three hundred packages,
<!-- Leaf 17, Page: VII -->
in my keeping, many of which were taken from plants of
undescribed genera, and by far the greater number from unknown species.
They formed part of the shipwrecked collection. *


From the kindness of Sir George Staunton, to whom I gave a
small collection of China plants, and of Captain Basil Hall, to whom
I gave a small collection of China rocks at Canton, I have derived all
the specimens which have enabled me to give the slight geological
and botanical notices of China contained in this work. To the latter
gentleman, and to his friend, Mr. Clifford, I am also under other
obligations of an important kind; and in naming them, have to
mention the loss of collections equalling my own in value. In
taking leave of the Embassy on its disembarkation in the Gulf of
Pe-tche-le, they took charge of a case of bottles with spirit, for the
purpose of preserving any interesting marine animal production
which might fall in their way; and the necessary means for the
preservation of plants. On rejoining the Embassy five months
afterwards, they presented me with a collection of Zoophytes and an
extensive collection of plants from the Lew-chew Islands. These also
perished with the Alceste, but do not complete my catalogue of losses.
A fine collection of madrepores made by Capt. Maxwell may be added
to them, and will still leave it unfinished. Whilst the Alceste and
Lyra explored the Corean coast and the Lew-chew islands, the other
ships of the Embassy visited the coast of Tartary. Lieut. Maughn,
of the East India Company's service, went with them, and
having taken directions as to the mode of preserving dried specimens
of plants, surprised me on my arrival at Canton with an extensive
geological and botanical collection from the coast of Tartary. These,
encreased by a collection which had been made from the same part of
the world, for Mr. Livingston, one of the surgeons to the British
factory at Canton, and which I received from the kindness of thatgentle
* After leaving the wreck of the Alceste, 1 had the mortification of hearing that the
cases containing these seeds had been brought upon deck and emptied oftheir contents by
one of the seamen, to make room for some of the linen of one of the gentlemen of the
Embassy.
<!-- Leaf 18, Page: VIII -->
man, were also placed in my possession, and shared the fate of my
other specimens. But I should fatigue the patience of my readers
without doing justice to my own feelings, if I attempted to state all
that I owe to the kindness and exertions of my friends and all that

they have left me to regret.


After these declarations respecting the loss of materials which
would have given value and interest to these pages, what, it may fairly
be asked, have I remaining of importance to the.public ? In looking
over my observations on the countries that I had visited, I was of
opinion that they contained something to interest, and something
to inform. It is not for me to judge how far I may have correctly
estimated the value of my matter; but I trust that the exclamation
of the Poet,  
  
  
  ibi omnis,  
  
  
  E<  
  
  
  " Effusus labor."

will not entirely apply to my pages. I have endeavoured to describe
things as I saw them; and when subjects arose incidentally from my
narrative, have tried to give them an extrinsic interest by noticing
the opinions of others and comparing them with my own. In doing
so, I have respected the freedom of my own mind, and have never
hesitated to express my thoughts, even when they differed from
high authority. I trust that my language has, on these occasions,
expressed the deference of my feeling. If, however, it should not
always be found exactly suited to my purpose, I beg that my readers
will charitably attribute it to my little experience in the niceties of
speech. Indeed, it is in what concerns the style of this work that
I am especially anxious to bespeak their indulgence. Little
practised in composition, I have been desirous to give my own thoughts
in my own words, and in doing so have not, I fear, benefited
the language of these pages, and have delayed them longer than
the merit of their contents may seem to have deserved. In
what regards my facts and conclusions I cannot feel much
apprehension : the first are, to the best of my judgment, strictly stated, and
<!-- Leaf 19, Page: IX -->
the last were drawn because they seemed to follow the premises, and
if they be not adopted will only have the fate of others better than
themselves.


In making acknowledgments it seems almost superfluous to state
that I am under the deepest obligations to Sir Joseph Banks, whose
support to my scientific views was the natural consequence of their
being laudable and useful. In leaving England I carried with me
his instructions respecting the objects to be kept most closely in
view during my absence, and since my return have derived from
the freest access to his library and herbarium all possible facilities
in constructing this work.


Of the assistance of Bobert Brown, Esq. the following pages bear
sufficient evidence. His description of a new genus, which, in
friendly partiality, he has named Abelia, and of two new species of
plants, the one leading to the establishment of a new natural order,
and the other fixing' the place in the natural method of a genus
hitherto of doubtful affinity, gives unequivocal value to my Appendix.


To Mr. Morrison's journal I owe in a great measure the short
account of the progress of the Embassy during the period of my
illness, and some interesting notes respecting transactions from which
I was absent. Some of these notes would have been incorporated
with the text had I possessed the journal at an earlier period. To
Mr. Cooke's journal I have been also much indebted, and to the
same gentleman I owe two drawings which illustrate the book. The
drawings of the Quercus Chinensis and Eurya Chinensis are from
the tried pencil of my friend W. Hooker, Esq. To Mr. H. Baper,
an officer of the Alceste, I am indebted for all the geological views,
except two, of the Cape of Good Hope, taken on the spot, and
possessing not their least value in their minute accuracy. The plate
of the temple of Quong-ying is from a sketch which I obtained from
the kindness of Sir George Staunton. The other drawings, not
bearing the names of professed artists, I am answerable for.

<!-- Leaf 20, Page: X -->

For that part of the " Chart showing the track of the Alceste,"
which gives the line of the Corean coast and the Corean archipelago, I
have to thank the Rev. Mr. Taylor, chaplain of the Alceste. The
more general map of China, and the map of the route of the Embassy
on the Yang-tse-kiang, are reduced from the great map of the Jesuits.
My object in giving the former has been to convey to the reader some
notion of that very peculiar character of the country, which arises from
its universal intersection by navigable rivers and canals, as well as to
show the whole route of the Embassy. Its accuracy of course depends
on that of the Jesuits, which we had no opportunity of verifying, but
had no occasion to suspect. It so far, however, differs from the
map of the Missionaries in containing the names of a greater number
of places in the line of our route than the original, and in having
the nature of the banks of the rivers passed over by the Embassy
marked upon it, when this could be done without producing
confusion by crowding the letter-press. The same observations apply
to the map of the Yang-tse-kiang and Po-yang lake.


The meteorological tables contained in the Appendix, although
very imperfect, will be thought perhaps to have merited insertion as
adding to the very few facts that we already possess regarding the
atmospherical phenomena of a part of the world so little known. I
have scarcely as much to say for the Itinerary of our route. It is of
some consequence in reference to the maps, and in containing
disstances extracted from a Chinese Itinerary: an excuse for its insertion
may be found in the small space which it occupies.


In conclusion, I must not forget to point out the fidelity with
which the engraver, Mr. Fielding, has executed his department of the
work, or to acknowledge the interest he took in the progress of it,
and his anxiety that the accuracy of his pencil should correspond
with the nicety of my own wishes in subjects not so frequently under
the eve of an artist.

  EMBASSY TO CHINA.  
  
  
  CHAPTER I.  
  
  
  DEPARTURE FROM PORTSMOUTH.

At three o'clock of the afternoon of February 8th, 1816, I embarked
with His Excellency Lord Amherst, on board H. M. S. Alceste, then
lying at Spithead. Getting under weigh at eight o'clock the
following morning, in company with H. M. S. Lyra, Capt. B. Hall,
and General Hewitt, Capt. Campbell, we steered with a fine breeze
through the Needles. In passing the shores of the Isle of Wight,
my imagination dwelt painfully on its white cliffs and verdant slopes,
which but three days before I had visited with friends who gave
the best value to my existence, and from whom I was separating,
perhaps for ever. But the painful feelings excited by such
reflections, too intense, indeed, for long continuance, were quickly
destroyed by my share of the bodily suffering which attacked, in
succession, the greater number of those, who then, for the first time,
felt the motion of a ship at sea. Scarcely had we cleared the western
extremity of the island, when an intolerable giddiness, languor, and
sickness, drove me to my cot, and had but slightly mitigated, when
the mountains of Madeira were descried from the ship.


Early in the morning of the 18th February, going upon deck, I
saw this interesting island bearing S. S. W., distant about six leagues.  
  
  
  B
<!-- Leaf 30, Page: XVIII -->
A thick white cloud covered its mountains, which gradually
dissipating as we advanced, disclosed their snowy summits beautifully
contrasting with the dark foliage of their declivities. The squadron
hove to about ten o'clock in the forenoon, off the town of Funchal,
at the distance of two or three leagues from the land.


Having prepared every thing for collecting objects of natural
history, I waited impatiently for the appearance of a boat, to carry me
to the fulfilment of my anticipations. Examining with my glass
the aspect of the rugged shores, I exulted in the geological interest
of their appearance, and collected, in imagination, plants which,
from number and rarity, would give a long and delightful
employment. What then was my disappointment, when I was informed
by His Excellency, that he wished no one to leave the ship, lest any
chance of delay should arise to the sailing of the Alceste, as soon as
she had obtained the necessary supplies. As Lord Amherst denied
himself, for public reasons, the pleasure which he much desired, of
visiting the island, no one of his suite had a shadow of right to
remonstrate, and I prepared to suffer my disappointment with all
possible patience. After the lapse, however, of two or three hours,
Capt. Campbell, of the General Hewitt, came on board, and offered
to take me on shore; and, being almost immediately to return, I
readily accompanied him.


On approaching the beach, where I had hoped to find some
specimens of sea-weed, I found the depth of water up to the shore so
great, that a vessel might almost anchor with her bowsprit over the
land, and consequently, that no marine production was to be met
with. The beach is made up of large rounded fragments of lava,
generally of a vesicular structure, very ponderous, and of a bluish  
  
  
  colour. Landing to the westward of the town, I found a mountain
torrent, having its bed sides formed of huge masses of volcanic matter,
as far as the eye could follow its romantic windings. I entered its
bed in search of plants, but found very few, as the apprehension of
losing my chance of returning to the ship prevented my looking very
narrowly. The Fumaria Parviflora, which was growing in great
<!-- Leaf 31, Page: 1 -->
abundance in all the crevices of the rocks, and a few geraniums, ferns,
and mosses, composed my collection.


Not finding the boat in readiness on my return to the beach, I
walked into the town, which I entered under an archway that led to
a long narrow street very well paved with round pebbles, and
perfectly clean, and which was intersected by others of a similar
character. The houses are lofty, and completely overshadow the narrow
streets, forming an effectual screen against the beams of a hot sun.
The softer sex, for here they cannot be called the fair sex, were
enjoying the air on virandas which projected from the first floor of the
better-looking houses, and were enabled by the narrowness of the streets
to converse freely with their opposite neighbours. The young ladies
of Madeira, although dark brunettes, possess many charms. Their
hair, and arching eye-brows, are of a jet black, and their eyes sparkle
under lashes of the same colour; their face is oval and expressive, and
handsome rather than beautiful.


The streets were filled with foot passengers, of whom no
inconsiderable number were priests, in long loose robes, and without hats.
They had evidently fared on the fat of the land; and many of them
exhibited in their countenances and deportment, a full share of
selfsatisfaction and self-importance. But the faces of others seemed
to be lightened with a paternal feeling, and physiognomists might
have traced in them characters of mildness, benignity, and religion.
Neither did they all receive the same marks of respect from the
passing populace. Sometimes the hat was simply raised, and the body
bowed, without any regard being directed to the object of this salute,
which was begun and ended at the instant of meeting. In other
cases, an eagerness was shown to catch the observation of the Father,
long before he approached, while a deprecating and beseeching manner
appeared to implore the blessing of a superior being. It was agreeable
to the harmony of my own sentiments, that these last attentions were
paid to those alone, whose exterior almost incited me to a similar
display of respectful feeling.  
  
  
  b 2
<!-- Leaf 32, Page: 2 -->

On quitting the town, I was disposed to conclude, that it had been
much improved since it was visited by its last describers; but as it
was Sunday when I was there, and all classes were enjoying the
leisure of the day in their best apparel, and as first impressions are
frequently erroneous, I shall confine myself to the remark, that what
I saw did not correspond with what I had read.


When I reached the Alceste, I found that I might have remained
on shore several hours, as some circumstances had occurred, which
prevented her immediate sailing; and she did not leave Funchal
Roads till the evening, when we got under weigh with a fine breeze.


As we proceeded on our voyage towards the Line, the tedium of
our situation was in some measure relieved, by the amusement we
derived from observing the habits of the flying-fish, which continually
surrounded us. This animal, equally interesting in its structure, and
in the circumstances of its persecuted life, has been so often the
theme of the traveller's description, that its very mention comes
with the heaviness of a twice-told tale. Yet, although its
descriptions are numerous, much is still wanting to the completion of its
natural history; and it is a subject of regret with naturalists, that its
species met with by voyagers, are not ascertainable. For these
reasons, and because " nature is an inexhaustible source of
investigation," I shall state the few observations which I made on a
specimen that was brought me on the morning of the 27th February,
when in lat. 10° 38' N, and 25° 47' W. long.; and I do this the more
readily, as its characters did not entirely accord with the description
of any other species.


The colour of its back was a deep blue, which passed on its sides
into a yellowish green, terminating in a silvery white, which, near
its tail, had a pinkish hue. Several small patches of white reached
from above its eye, to the pectoral fin. Its fins were six in number;
two pectoral, two ventral, one caudal, and one dorsal. The pectoral
fin consisted of fourteen rays, and was five inches in its greatest
length, and as much in its greatest width. The two undermost rays,
when the wing was expanded, were very short, and scarcely

<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P33_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 35, Page: 5 -->
guishable from those next them, and the uppermost ray was the
longest. Each ventral fin consisted of six rays, and was situated
immediately behind the insertion of the pectoral fin. The dorsal
fin, the rays of which were so indistinct that I cannot venture to
state their number, had its origin about two-thirds down the back.
The caudal fin was an inch long, and terminated at the setting on
of the tail.


From the above description, it will appear that my specimen
resembled the Exocætus Volitans in the position of the ventral fins,
but differed from it in colour, which in the latter is brownish red on
the back. It agreed with Exocætus Exiliens and Mesogaster, in its
general colour, but differed from them in the position of its ventral
fins. It was distinguished from them all by the position of its dorsal
fins. Should these differences be considered sufficient to establish
it as a new species, I would propose to call it Exocætus * Splendens,
from the brilliancy of its colours.


The species which I have just described is furnished with as ample
means of supporting itself in air as any of its congeners. Its
airbladder reaches from the pharyngeal bones along the spine to the
extremity of its body, occupying eight-tenths of its whole length. The
widest part of the air-bladder is situated immediately in front of the
pectoral fins, and it tapers gradually towards the tail. It is equal in
bulk to about four-tenths of the whole fish.


A particular purpose seems to be answered by the greater
dimension of the air-bladder near the head, namely, the compensation of the
great gravity of the animal at this part in consequence of its breadth.
This compensation is necessary to the support of the animal's body in
the air in a favourable position for flight. The situation of the
pectoral fins before the centre of gravity in this, as in other flying-fish,
also tends to elevate the head, as remarked by Lacepede.-j* If the white spots on its head be peculiar, Exocætus Maculatus would be a better

name.  
  
  
  f Histoire Naturelle des Poissons, vol. v. p. 406. Lacepede has made the situation of
<!-- Leaf 36, Page: 6 -->

It has been stated by a naturalist * of the highest eminence, that
the pectoral fins of the flying-fish serve only as a parachute, and by
another f that " the animal beats the air during the leap, that is, it
alternately extends and closes its pectoral fins." With this last
observation my own experience perfectly agrees. I have repeatedly seen
the motion of the fins during its flight, and as flight is only "
swimming in air," it appears natural that these organs should be used in
the same manner in both elements. The flying-fish is also much
nearer in conformation to the bat, which supports itself in the air by
repeated percussion, than to the flying squirrel, and other animals,
whose structure only enables them to fall slowly. I may also remark,
that when the fin of the flying-fish expands, its rays do not open in
the same line, but describing a curve strike the air with repeated
impulses.


I found it impossible to satisfy my mind with any probable
conjecture respecting the greatest space through which these fish can
support themselves in air, but I have seen them fly without once
touching the water for fifty seconds, and my eye could not follow
them till they fell. I have little doubt that they take to the air, as
well for pleasure as to escape their enemies, since they were often
seen rising about the ship in all directions, when no foe was visibly
near, and when they had not been disturbed by the ship's motion
through the water. Indeed I have been disposed to think myself
unfortunate in not witnessing, during the whole voyage, a single
flying-fish taken by a frigate-bird, or dorado; and I therefore venture
to hope that these poor animals are not so persecuted a race as
travellers have been led to imagine.


It is impossible to reflect on the habits of the flying-fish without
considering its power of respiring in air. In treating of therespirthe dorsal fin opposite to the anal fin an essential character of the genus Exocætus. Is it a
universal character, or is the situation of the dorsal fin in my specimen a mere exception
to a general law ?

<!-- Leaf 37, Page: 7 -->
ation of fishes, the possibility of their air-bladder acting subsidiarily
to the branchiæ, has not passed unnoticed by authors; but I am not
aware that this organ in the flying-fish has been pointed out as likely
to assist the respiration of that animal out of the water. And yet
I had once flattered myself with the belief that I had discovered its
communication with the mouth under such circumstances of
organisation as precluded any doubt of its aiding the function of aerial
respiration. But I had only one opportunity of dissecting the animal
when recently taken, and I dare not trust to a single observation. I
would recommend however those, whose opportunities are frequent
of possessing the flying-fish soon after death, to examine attentively
the termination of its air-bladder at the pharyngeal bones. These
bones, in all other fish * which I have examined, are two in number,
and much apart, their office being to assist deglutition and to shield
the blood-vessels which ramify under them on their way to the
branchiæ. In the flying-fish their number and position is different,
allowing the inference that their function is also different. They are
in this animal four in number, two large and two small. The two
former in close apposition are situated immediately above and behind
the anterior orifice of the œsophagus, and are compressed by the
latter, which are united to them by a strong elastic membrane.
Muscles are attached to the larger bones so as to separate them by
their contraction. The anterior termination of the air-bladder is at the
posterior portion of the larger bones. The question to be determined
is, whether the air-bladder has an orifice at this part, which is opened
and closed by the separation and re-union of the pharyngeal bones.


On the evening of the 4th March we passed the line, and on the
following morning shortened sail, to pay the usual homage to
Neptune, which being accomplished we proceeded on our voyage.


* Since my return I have examined a specimen of the Exocætus Mesogaster, preserved
in spirit, in which the two large bones were united, but there was an orifice between them
and the small ones; whether it led into the air-bladder or not I was unable to determine.
The same specimen had only eight, instead of ten, rays to its branchiæ.

On the 10th, being in 10° 39' S. Lat., and 32° 47' W. Long., the
Alceste parted company from the Lyra and General Hewitt, which
shaped their course for the Cape, whilst the former steered for the
harbour of Rio de Janeiro. On the 20th, we were off Cape Frio, and
all those who had never before visited the shores of South America
anxiously speculated on the scenes they were about to witness in the
New World.


The affections of different minds on first approaching an
interesting coast, might form a subject of curious and instructive
speculation. When the land indeed appears but as a dark undefined
speck in the distant horizon, first reflections cannot widely differ,
although their vividness may depend on the sensibility of the
individual, and their extensiveness on the number of his associations.
But few educated men will approach a country for the first time of
their lives, without reverting to the history of its conquest or
discovery. On making the coast of the New World, so interesting
in the history of man and of the earth, every thought must centre in
Columbus. All the circumstances of his situation on the day of his
discovery, all the attributes of his mind, and all the heroism of his
conduct, array themselves in the imagination. But as the land
developes itself, as its larger features become visible, speculation is
extinguished in a general glow of undefined but delightful feeling.
Never can I forget the pleasing, yet almost awful emotion of my
mind, when rising early in the morning I first beheld the shores of
South America expanded before me. To describe the scenery by
words would be a vain attempt; the pencil of a painter enthusiastic
in genius and in feeling, could alone convey to those who have never
beheld it an imperfect apprehension of its grandeur.


As objects become still more defined and palpable, various trains
of thought arise in different characters. In the commander of a
British ship of war, the hope of finding refreshments for his
crew, of meeting old friends, of carrying his ship into port in
a skilful and gallant style, and of supporting the proud
<!-- Leaf 39, Page: 9 -->
preeminence of his flag, is perhaps on ordinary occasions the leading
sentiment of his mind. — In many of his officers, an escape from
subordination to the independence of a rove on shore, with all
the importance really and in imagination attached to the character
of a British naval officer, may be the chief pleasurable
expectation. In one or two of them, indeed, very different feelings
may arise. Habit sometimes acts so powerfully on a seaman's
nature, that all his pleasing associations are of a nautical
character, and whatever interrupts their train is to him a positive evil.
To such a character the appearance of land, so dear to others,
brings with it no pleasing emotion, and is irksome in proportion to
his chances of delay. — The professor, or admirer of the pictorial art,
dwells on the exterior characters of the scene, collects all the
great traits by which a sublime picture is formed, and anticipates
the interior beauties of the country of which he contemplates the
outline.—The speculator on human character, varied by the
modifying influence of climate, religion, and government, takes his
own species as the subject of his examination. As the inhabitants
of different classes appear, he combines them in an imaginary
society, owing its character to his previous conclusions, but which he
expects will be found consistent with reality. — Over all these, the
naturalist has many advantages both with respect to pleasurable
expectation and the chances of its fulfilment. The objects of his
studies are infinitely numerous, and each in its simple relations is so
completely a centre of observation, that he must always be repaid for
the labour of research. On first entering the harbour of Rio Janeiro,
he feels unutterable delight. No apprehension of disappointment
darkens his prospect. The certainty of meeting Nature in her gayest
and most exalted colours, in all her varied and attracted forms, gives
him unmixed enjoyment. The brilliant tints of the mountain foliage
feed his botanical imagination, whilst the dazzling insects which
flutter about the ship tell to him the stores of animated nature. As
a geologist, he may almost remain on the deck of the vessel andpro* c
<!-- Leaf 40, Page: 10 -->
secute his labours. Immense ridges of primitive mountains, traversed
by deep ravines, and rising in succession to the very boundary ot
his vision, afford him an ample subject of interesting investigation.

Long before the Alceste reached her anchorage, the firing of
cannon at regular intervals announced the occurrence of some great
public event, and as soon as we communicated with other ships in
the harbour, we were informed of the death of the Queen of
Portugal. Vessels of all nations that were at this time lying off St.
Sebastian, showed their respect to the King of Portugal by crossing
their yards, hoisting flags half mast hi^h, and firing guns every five
minutes. The Alceste followed their example; and as a farther mark
of respect, the British Ambassador determined to appear on shore
with some outward badge of mourning, and requested the gentlemen
of his suite to do the same.


It was the afternoon before we anchored, and dark before I could
gratify my impatience to visit the shore. The city of St. Sebastian
has undergone so little alteration since it was described by Mr.
Barrow, that any account of it which I could give from my limited
means of observation would be superfluous. The darkness of the
night prevented my seeing much of the inhabitants, but those who
did fall under my passing notice were priests riding in their carriages,
friars in procession, and ladies peeping from latticed doors. In
company with some friends I hastened to the Caza de Pasto in the
Rua D'Alfandaga, the best English hotel in the place, which,
although it did not possess the comforts of a similar establishment
at home, afforded no ordinary fare, and very civil treatment made us
less fastidious respecting our entertainment. Having partaken of a
supper at which we were supplied with tolerable claret at three
shillings a bottle, we enquired for beds. The house contained no

distinct bed-rooms and but few beds; but in a large billiard-room,
with the assistance of the billiard-table, chairs, and sofas, our party,
though numerous, mustered a sufficient number of separate resting
places. The dread of musquitoes, the scourge of Europeans in hot
<!-- Leaf 41, Page: 11 -->
countries, did not disturb our repose, and we were glad to find in
the morning that we had not suffered from their attack.*


I set out at an early hour on my return to the ship, and on my way
through the town had an opportunity of taking a hasty glance at the
morning employments of some of its inhabitants. Walking by the
chief fountain which supplies the city, I was surprised at the great
number of slaves who were waiting with vessels to receive in
succession a measured quantity of water, and I witnessed the same scene at
whatever hour in the day I passed this spot. St. Sebastian is badly
supplied with this article, although numerous springs rise every where
in its neighourhood within the distance of one or two miles. But the
Portuguese in this country require some powerful and present
necessity to rouse them to any great exertion, and it is less a matter of
wonder that they suffer this inconvenience to exist, than that they
ever should have attempted and completed so extensive a work as
the aqueduct which supplies the city.


In passing the fish and vegetable market at the southern extremity
of the town, every sense I possessed became disagreeably impressed.
My hearing, by the jargon of the different languages used by the
slaves who were bartering for their masters, and by the old women
who were endeavouring to obtain the highest price for their articles
of sale. My sense of sight and of smell, by a horrible combination of
every sort of filth, which sent forth the most sickening effluvia that
ever exhaled from the corruption of a charnel-house. The very air
tasted of putridity, and my clothes felt unctuous to the touch from
accidental contamination. Some of my companions who were old
travellers felt disposed to joke at my squeamishness, and having
bought a large quantity of fruit and fish, hired a canoe which carried
us and our steaming cargo on board.


* A drought had prevailed at Rio for some weeks previous to our visit, which is always
unfavourable to the propagation of these formidable insects. I have found that rubbing
the skin with camphorated oil is the best protection against their attack.  
  
  
  c 2
<!-- Leaf 42, Page: 12 -->

On reaching the ship, I prepared every thing for making collections
of plants, and set off in company with some friends on an excursion
to the Braganza shore.* We landed at the foot of a small fort, which
was in a state of as complete disservice as it is possible to imagine.
The guns, from their rust and the rottenness of their carriages, could
be formidable only to those who should attempt to discharge them.
Yet as the war had but recently terminated, and this fort commanded
an important part of the harbour, it might have been expected to be in
a tolerable state of repair. From the fort we divided ourselves into
different groups, and ascending the rocky hills that surrounded
us, entered the woods which every where covered their summits.
Taking a road which led through one of the thickest, I soon found
myself encompassed by all the beauties of Flora. Sensations never
before experienced, for some minutes, entirely overwhelmed me.
It was the first time that I had ever seen the glorious productions
of a tropical climate in their native soil. Plants, which in England
are reared at great expense, and obtain under the best management
but a puny and uncharacteristic form, flourished around me in all the
vigour and luxuriance of their perfect being. A thick coppice was
formed by numerous species of cassia cæsalpinia and bauhinia, whose
gay colours and elegant forms were curiously contrasted with the
grotesque characters of the aloe and the cactus. The trunks of the
forest-trees were covered with beautiful creepers, and parasitic ferns
occupied their branches. Emerging from the wood, I entered groves
of orange-trees, bearing fruit and flowers in the greatest profusion.
I approached them in wonder, and scarcely dared to taste their
abundant produce, when I was astonished by receiving permission to gather
them in any quantity; and this permission was not confined to myself,
but granted to all my companions, who successively visited the place of
their growth. Indeed, nothing could surpass the liberality of the
proprietors of orange-groves, or of the Portuguese peasantry whom I


* The shore on the opposite side of the harbour to that on which the city of St.
Sebastian stands.
<!-- Leaf 43, Page: 13 -->
met with in my different excursions in the neighbourhood of Rio.
Whenever they could understand me they gratified my wishes in the
most prompt and obliging manner. Having laden" myself with plants,
I returned in the evening along the rocky beach to my boat, walking
at every step over land-crabs and the larvæ of insects, whose numbers
gave an appearance of animation to the soil.


On the following morning I again visited the town; and, having
procured horses, went with two of the officers of the Alceste on a
visit to the Sugar-Loaf Mountain, but was unable to approach it very
near. I ascertained, however, that it was surrounded by interesting
scenery, and determined to revisit it by water the succeeding
morning.


Returning from my ride through the city of St. Sebastian, I fell
in with a group of negro slaves who were assembled at the corner
of a street, listening with great delight to one of their own tribe
playing on a very rude musical instrument. It consisted of a few
wires fixed to a small square frame, placed over a large segment of
the shell of the coco-nut. I requested one of his companions to
accompany the instrument with his voice, which he immediately did,
in a monotonous, though not unpleasing tone. Another performer
accompanied the last notes by wild and expressive gesticulations, in
which he was followed by most of the bye-standers. It was more
than probable that national remembrances animated both performers
and auditors. Nothing less powerful, surely, could excite the strong
emotion which agitated their frames; and I was, in some measure,
confirmed in this opinion by what followed. Having bought the
instrument, I slung it on my arm, and rode with it through the streets
to the English hotel. Every slave whose eye caught my appendage
uttered as I passed a cry of surprise: it was also one of joy and
exultation. His dark countenance assumed the liveliest expression,
and his whole attitude marked the strong sensation excited by the
appearance of a stranger, a white and a free man, bearing, perhaps,
his national emblem, under such circumstances, reviving the
<!-- Leaf 44, Page: 14 -->
recollection of that liberty and that home from which he had been impiously
and for ever torn. *


The number of slaves imported into Rio Janeiro has greatly
increased during the last year, in consequence of the abolition which
is to take place in five years, according to the treaty between the
British and Portuguese governments. But although this effect of
British interference in behalf of suffering humanity is much to be
deplored, the great and beneficial alteration which it has produced
in the treatment of its unfortunate objects more than compensates
the temporary evil. With the view of obtaining a stock of slaves
that may supply the wants of the colony when the trade in them
shall have become unlawful, the Portuguese have adopted the
measure of selecting from the market the most vigorous and
handsome of the two sexes, and establishing them in pairs in different
parts of their estates. The object of this plan is sufficiently obvious,
and it will probably be obtained. Promiscuous and unrestrained
intercourse has been much allowed among the slaves in Rio Janeiro,
and experience has of course shown that it is unfavourable to
population. Whilst a ready, cheap, and exhaustless supply was open,
slaveowners cared very little about the best means of keeping up their
stock by breeding; but they have been induced by the apprehension
that the trade will become contraband at the expiration of five years,
to attempt every possible method of increasing the number of their
human cattle; and as this cannot be accomplished without attention
to good feeding and general comfort, they will, probably, (without
any better feelings on the score of humanity,) render the state of
slavery more tolerable amongst them. I blush to observe the
phraseology I use in writing of my fellow men, but I can in no other


* On the subject of the slave-trade in South America, I had collected some facts
during my short continuance at Rio, which I had intended to give as illustrative of its
extent, increase, cruelty, and impolicy; but I find in the lucid and ample details of
Mr. Koster, so complete a developement of every circumstance which it involves, that any
detail from me respecting it, would be equally useless and impertinent.
<!-- Leaf 45, Page: 15 -->
way express the relation which exists between the master and his
slave.


It is affirmed that three-fourths of the population of St. Sebastian
are blacks; and, indeed, their visible number is so great, that a
stranger unacquainted with the slave-trade, and visiting this city,
might imagine that the slaves were its proper inhabitants, and their
masters its casual dwellers. He would also be liable to conclude
that its municipal laws were not very effective, as he could scarcely
traverse a street without meeting troops of Africans chained together,
dragging heavy clogs, or exhibiting on their shoulders the marks of
lashes.


It was stated that within the last year, twenty thousand had been
imported into the province of Rio Janeiro through the port of St.
Sebastian, a part of whom filled the markets, and others had not yet
disembarked. A ship-load of them was one of the first objects which
met our sight on reaching the harbour. They were arranged upon
deck, tier above tier, and their bare heads and uniform countenances,
(uniform from equal expression of despondence,) exhibited a frightful
picture of aggregate misery. It may be thought, perhaps, that since
the slave-trade is diminishing, and the state of slavery ameliorating,
these remarks are unnecessary; but, in my opinion, the subject is
not an exhausted one. Those countries that have consented through
the interference of England to its abolition, have done so most
reluctantly, and in no instance from principle. They all carry it on in a
smuggling manner; and unless the good sense and humanity of the
enlightened part of mankind be constantly on the watch against the
sordid views of those persons whose immediate interest and opinions
favour this bloody traffic, it will rise to all its former capabilities
of inducing human misery, although its practices may not be so
flagrantly displayed to the world. I much fear, from what I have
heard, that in some of our own colonies, human bondage yet exists
in its worst form, and still operates in producing its peculiar effect
that of hardening the heart of man against the sufferings of his
fellowcreatures.
<!-- Leaf 46, Page: 16 -->

It ought always to be kept in mind that the slave-trade, and not
slavery, has been attempted to be abolished; that both exist in
several parts of the world in the full possession of their horrid
attributes; and, to use the words of an eloquent writer, " that from
slavery in its mildest form, oppression, injustice, and cruelty are
inseparable. These crimes have, from the beginning of it, formed
its basis, and without them it can no more subsist than a house
without a foundation."


I visited the Sugar-Loaf Mountain by water on the following day,
and forgot, in the delightful scenery of its vicinage, my previous
unpleasant reflections. As I approached a small fort near its base,
I was challenged by a sentry, who ordered me to land, and to satisfy
his officer respecting my object in visiting the coast. I obeyed,
and was led into a fortress, strong in itself, but overlooked by the
adjacent hills. Its commandant questioned me at first rather roughly
as to my intention in coming there; but as soon as he ascertained
the nature of my pursuits, and that I belonged to the British embassy,
he became very civil, and described to me the nearest way to the
foot of the mountain.


The Sugar-Loaf Mountain is a huge entire rock of granite, seven
hundred feet in height, and owes its name to its conical form. It
stands by itself, and the side facing the harbour is nearly perpendicular
throughout. I had hoped to ascend to its summit, but the appearance
of its precipitous sides effectually prevented my making the attempt.
The scenery about its base was more pleasing than any other which
I had an opportunity of seeing while at Rio Janeiro. Other parts of
the country afforded views more imposing, from the immensity oftheir
features; but they rather disappointed than satisfied the mind, from
its incapacity to grasp their extent. On the contrary, in the
neiohbourhood of this mountain, they are on a scale within the compass
of the mind's observation, and yet possess those characters of
wildness, richness, and grandeur, which mark the landscape of this
country. Standing on the beach, with my back to the sea, I had
immediately before me the dark face of the mountain rising from a
<!-- Leaf 47, Page: 17 -->
wood of flowering trees. On my right hand, the same wood climbed,
in a curve, the sides of precipitous ground, and was intersected by
winding paths leading to a rugged rock. On the verge of this hung
a picturesque cottage, and at its foot, groves of orange trees afforded
a retreat from an unclouded sun, whose beams, darting through the
intervals of their foliage, exhibited beautiful contrasts of light and
shade. On my left, the land sloped in gentle undulations towards
the sea, into which it ran in a narrow and rocky promontory: on
this was built the fort near which I had landed. The effect of the
scene was much heightened by the cooling sea-breezes; which,
blowing over fields of flowers, came charged with delicious fragrance.


Having satiated myself with the contemplation of the objects
around me, and collected many interesting birds, insects, and plants,
I returned to my boat, and coasted along the rocky shore, which
runs in steep declivities to the water's edge. I gathered on my way
several specimens of Fuci and Confervæ, which included a greater
number of species, than from the reported barrenness of these shores
I had been led to expect. I doubt not, that a botanist, with a
sufficient command of time, might collect from them treasures that would
more than repay him for the trouble of his research. It is true, that
as the shores are rocky and steep, they are seldom thrown upon land,
and must therefore be gathered from their places of growth, which
cannot be accomplished without frequently wading; but this, in a hot
climate, is both wholesome and pleasant.


My next excursion led me to the Botanic Garden, distant about
six miles from the town of St. Sebastian. The day was excessively
hot; and my walk was through a deep sandy lane; but small houses
of refreshment were numerous on the side of the road, which afforded
the means of allaying thirst, at the most moderate expense: for
three half-pence, as much lemonade, or weak brandy and water,
was handed to me, as I could prudently drink. Such beverage
would have been more grateful, had it partaken less of a local
character; but as a traveller, I did not scruple to swallow, at every
draught, a considerable number of ants, and a proportionatequanD
<!-- Leaf 48, Page: 18 -->
tity of dirt. On reaching the Botanic Garden, I received from the
kindness of Senhor Gomez, its curator, refreshment of a more
substantial and attractive kind.


The Botanic Garden is of considerable extent; and if its support
by the Portuguese government was proportionate to the zeal of its
superintendant, and the means of its improvement, it would become
the first establishment of the kind in the world. The climate would
favour the growth of all the plants of the east; and there can be no
doubt, that such of them as afford commercial produce, might be
cultivated with success and profit. But it has no other care bestowed
on its management than what it receives through the judgment and
exertion of Senhor Gomez, whose particular appointment is that of
superintendant of some powder-mills situated in its neighbourhood.


This gentleman has, notwithstanding the defects of its establishment,
contrived through the aid of a few Chinese gardeners, to cultivate
the Tea-plant with great success. It was in seed at the time of my
visit, and its leaves had been repeatedly and effectively manufactured.
The process pursued is very simple. The leaves are gathered in the
month of January, after heavy falls of rain, before they are wholly
expanded, care being taken that no foot-stalks are mingled with them;
they are then put into an iron vessel, and exposed to heat till they begin
to shrink; when they are taken out, and rolled between the hands till
they become spirally folded. They are then returned into the vessel,
and again exposed to heat till it becomes intolerable to the hand, which
continually agitates them, to prevent their burning; and thus the
process is finished.


Many other Chinese plants, besides the Tea, were growing in the
garden in full vigour. Amongst these, the Tallow-tree (Stillingia
Sebifera), the Wax-tree (Ligustrum Lucidum), and Camellia
Sesanqua, were the most conspicuous. The last-mentioned plant, Senhor
Gomez was disposed to call the Thea Oleifera, from the belief, that
it is not a Camellia, but a Thea, and that it is the Oil-plant of the
Chinese. In the former opinion, he is probably correct; in the
latter, he accords with the statement of others; but in another part
<!-- Leaf 49, Page: 19 -->
of this work, I shall have occasion to show, that the Camellia
sasanqua is not the oil plant of the Chinese.- The Cactus opuntia, which
was formerly cultivated in this garden for the purpose of rearing the
Cochineal insect, is now altogether neglected.


The Ipecacuanha plant of the Brazils grows in great quantity in
the woods in the neighbourhood of the Botanic Garden, whence
it is collected by the country people for the market. I lamented
much, that the shortness of my stay at Rio di Janeiro prevented my
obtaining this plant, of which so many confused accounts have
been given. The difficulty of determining the plants producing the
Ipecacuanha of commerce, appears to have been occasioned by the
supposition, that it is entirely derived from one species; whereas
there can be no doubt that it is afforded by two at least of different
genera. A short history of the descriptions given of these by various
writers, will perhaps be decisive in showing from what plants it is all
obtained.


Piso and Margraave were the first who described the Ipecacuanha
plant of the Brazils, but neither their figures nor descriptions were
sufficiently precise to determine its genus. In 1781, Linnæus
published a description which he had received from Mutis, governor of
Santa Fe, of the Ipecacuanha plant of New Spain, under the genus
Psychotria.* In 1801, a complete monograph of the Ipecacuanha
plant of the Brazils was published by Brotero f, at Lisbon,
from specimens furnished to him by Bernardino Antonio Gomez,
who accompanied them by a dissertation on the characters,
properties and culture of the plant. It was named by these authors
Callicocca ipecacuanha. The plant of Gomez and Brotero has since
been confounded with that of Mutis : in other words, the Psychotria
emetica of Linnæus, and the Callicocca Ipecacuanha of Brotero,
have been referred to the same plants by Persoon, who has described  
  
  
  * Linn. Supplem. Plant, p. 144. f Memoria sobre A. Ipecacuanha Fusca, p. 57.
\ Persoon, Synopsis, p. 203.  
  
  
  * D 2
<!-- Leaf 50, Page: 20 -->
it under the genus Cephaelis. That they are essentially distinct,
however, will readily appear from the comparison of their
descriptions given in the Appendix.* Humboldt j- and Bonpland have
also very lately described and figured the Psychotria emetica as the
Ipecacuanha of New Spain.


The Callicocca ipecacuanha grows, according to Brotero, in shady
and moist places in Pernambuco, Bahia, Rio di Janeiro, and othei
provinces of the Brazils. The Psychotria emetica according to
Humboldt " is cultivated in the warm and humid valleys of the mountains
of San Lucar, near Simiti and Giron; and also in the district called
La Vara de Guammoco, to the west of the river Magdalen." It is
therefore evident, that two plants of different genera, one a native of
North, the other of South America, produce the Ipecacuanha of
commerce. The first reaches Europe from Carthagena in America, by
the way of Cadiz; and the latter probably from the ports of St.
Sebastian and St. Salvador, through Lisbon.


The plant which grows in the neighbourhood of the Botanic Garden
was, indeed, supposed by Senhor Gomez, to be the Psychotria emetica
of Linnæus; but the description with which he favoured me proves,
I think, that it is the Callicocca of Brotero. \


Two other plants also grew in the immediate vicinity of the
Botanic Garden, which possess emetic and purgative properties, but
in a less degree than the Psychotria or Callicocca. These are also
collected for medicinal purposes, and are sometimes confounded with,
and sold for the true Ipecacuanha. They are the Richardia scabra
of Linnæus, called in Rio the White Ipecacuanha, probably the

Ipecacounha Blanca of Piso, and the Viola Ipecacuanha of Linnæus,
known under the name of the false Ipecacuanha.


During the time I remained at the Botanic Garden, I received
every possible attention from S. Gomez, and lamented much that
the advance of the day obliged me to quit it when I had seen only
a small portion of its treasures.


As I returned to St. Sebastian, my path was illuminated by
myriads of fire flies, whirling in the air, or lighting on trees. At a
distance these insects resembled stars of great brilliancy, but as I
approached them, their rapid and varied motion, and their vivid
scintillations amidst dense foliage, disclosing patches of its most
attractive hues, exhibited a transporting scene of novelty and beauty.
It was perhaps equalled by the waves of silvery light, over which
the boat glided that carried me from the shore to the Alceste.


One more excursion completed my opportunities of examining the
scenery and productions of Rio. In this I visited many of the
islands, scattered in great numbers over its harbour. These are much
diversified in their forms, but are all of a similar geological
structure. Their basis is granite, with large flesh-coloured crystals of
Felspar. Their surface is a thin but rich soil of a red colour, and
formed by the decomposition of the rock beneath. They are clothed
with a luxuriant foliage, mingled with blossoms, whose colour and
fragrance is only surpassed by the flavour and refreshing qualities of
their fruits. Oranges, bananas, Cashew apples, and water melons,
are their common produce.


These islands vary very much in size, being from 200 yards to one
mile in diameter, and are frequently occupied by a single habitation.
The oranges which grow on them were larger, more juicy, and of a
better flavour than any I had tasted from the main land. The sailors
were permitted to gather them in any quantity, with no other request
on the part of their owners, than that care should be taken not to
break the branches of the trees.


These well clothed islands are in some respects less interesting
than the bare rocks in their neighbourhood, which rise in isolated
<!-- Leaf 52, Page: 22 -->
masses from the surface of the water. They are generally of a conical
form, rising from 10 to 50 feet in height, and are seldom more
than 60 or 100 feet in circumference. They seem to be the apices
of cones, whose bases are under water. I sounded round one of
the smallest, and found within a yard of its side 15 feet water, which
rapidly deepened as I withdrew from it. The larger of these rocky
islets do not consist of single masses, but are broken into several of
singular shapes. In more than one instance, I saw a large cone of
granite, 30 feet high, split from its very apex to its base, the parts
of which had seceded against their gravity; proving, I imagine, that,
their separation could not have been the consequenee of
disintegration. Was it produced by a cause coeval with their appearance
above the surface of the water ?


Could I have dwelt on the appearances presented by the exposed
surfaces of these rocks, I should have found perhaps many interesting
geological facts, traced upon them in very legible characters. But
the time I was enabled to spend in their examination allowed me to
derive little else from their contemplation than thepain of
awakened, but unsatisfied curiosity.


My pursuits having separated me from the suite of His Excellency,
I lost the opportunity of witnessing the funeral solemnities of the
Queen of Portugal. But from the information I obtained from those
who saw them, I missed but little which my imagination had not
supplied. I heard the tolling of bells, and the firing of cannon; and
when to these my fancy added their other elements in the church,
illumination, magnificent bier, chanting, and solemn response; in
the streets, the glare of torches, priests, and nobles in procession,
crowds of by-standers, and soldiers keeping the ground, I formed
a picture which, if not agreeable to reality, was at least satisfactory
to myself.


On taking leave of Rio de Janeiro, I feel desirous of leaving on
the minds of my readers some general notion of the characteristic
features of the city of St. Sebastian, and of the country in its
neighbourhood; but I fear any description in my power to give would be
<!-- Leaf 53, Page: 23 -->
inadequate to this object. The strongest efforts of the imagination
cannot picture any thing so heavenly as the country, or so disgusting
as the town. The first contains many of the noblest works of nature in
their greatest freshness and beauty, on a magnificent scale; the latter
exhibits all the disgusting objects which pride, slavery, laziness, and
filth can possibly engender. When I state that the face of high
mountains is often covered with a sheet, of blossom, a faint
apprehension may perhaps be formed of the beauties of the country; but
when I aver that on entering some parts of the town, I almost
lamented that I had an organ of smell, I give no idea of the stench
which exhales from the accumulated ordure of its* streets.
<!-- Leaf 54, Page: 24 -->
  
  CHAPTER II.

The Alceste left the harbour of Rio de Janeiro on the morning of
the 31st of March, and after a very rapid passage, arrived off the Cape
of Good Hope, and anchored in Table Bay, on the afternoon of the
18th of April.


We remained at the Cape till the 5th of May, when the Alceste
sailed for the Straights of Sunda. The Lyra and General Hewitt
had been dispatched nine days before, but our superior sailing enabled
us to gain rapidly upon them, and we anchored in Anyer Roads on
the 9th of June, two days after them.


Whilst at anchor I had an opportunity of examining a large shark,
which was taken the day after our arrival. This animal, which
measured twelve feet in length, was torn in pieces by the sailors the
instant it was fairly on deck. They drew from its stomach a whole
buffaloe's hide, two buffaloes' tails, one whole fowl, and the bones of
another, the remains of several snakes, and a mass of matter of
which it was impossible to ascertain the nature.


With some difficulty I made sufficient interest with its furious
mutilators, to obtain its eye, the structure of which I was anxious
to learn. It is supported on a firm cartilaginous stem, which
arises from the bottom of the socket*, and passing by the side of
the optic nerve, is articulated to the ball by a joint which permits
motion in every direction. This joint is the centre of motion
to six strong muscles that arise from the interior of the orbit,
and are so inserted in the ball of the eye, that their whole action


* This structure has been pointed out by a celebrated naturalist, who considers the
cartilaginous stem as a lever to the muscles. The same naturalist also observes, that
the stem is articulated with the lower part of the orbit. Lecons d'Anatomie Comparee,
torn. ii. p. 425.
<!-- Leaf 55, Page: 25 -->
amounts to the circumference of a circle, whose diameter is that of
the portion of the ball comprehended within their points of insertion.
This organisation seems necessary in the shark, which takes its prey
by turning on its back, to enable it to keep its object in view when
preparing to seize it. The eye balanced on a pivot is obviously
capable of a greater extent of motion, in any direction, than when
imbedded in the gelatinous matter, which lines the eye-sockets of
most other fish.


With the shark I obtained a specimen of the sucking fish,
(Echeneis Remora,) which I mention chiefly to remark, that it adheres as
strongly to any surface when dead as alive. It is very difficult to
remove it from any body to which it is applied, by pulling it
perpendicularly, or backwards, but it readily yields when drawn off in the
direction of its head. On examining its organ of adhesion with a
lens, the cause of this readily appears. The plates composing it,
which look single and membranous to the naked eye, under a
microscope are seen to be divided each into several smaller plates, and
armed with a row of fine teeth directed backwards. I was not
surprised that its English name had produced a steady belief in some
of my ship-mates, that it derived nourishment from the shark to
which it adhered.


This fish has no air-bladder, and must therefore (as its fins and
tail are small) depend chiefly on the animals to which it is attached
for progressive motion. For the same reason it cannot go in
search of food, but must depend on something that passes near it for
subsistence. The stomach of the specimen which I examined
contained some filmy matter which looked like the remains of
zoophytes.


These notices may appear of little importance. I insert them
from the conviction, that if every observation was recorded which
has" been made on the structure and habits of rare animals by those
who have seen them alive, and in their native climates, much valuable
information would now exist which is lost to the world. I know
from experience, that many individuals of a ship are often wellquaE

lifted to ascertain important facts on both these points. I have
repeatedly seen an ardent curiosity excited by my pursuits in the
minds of those whose general habits of life would appear least likely
to render them observers of nature; and I have been indebted to their
industry, intelligence, and kindness, for the possession of a number of
specimens and remarks, which, if they had not been unfortunately
lost in the shipwreck of the Alceste, would better prove than words
the correctness of my statement.


The medical officers of ships of war, and of Indiamen, are especially
fitted for the pursuit of natural history, and still more so for that
of comparative anatomy, and they do frequently make these
departments of knowledge the objects of their study. But their modesty,
looking to the extent of knowledge embraced by the masters of
science, underrates the value of their acquirements. Many also are
deterred from aiming at discovery, from the belief that they cannot
tread a path which has not been before explored, or that the
quantity of information necessary to give effect to their endeavours, requires
exclusive occupation to obtain. But, surely, no part of knowledge
is yet exhausted, and much that has been done requires to be
modified; and it is one of the peculiar advantages of the present age,
that the lover of natural history, instead of toiling through myriads
of books to ascertain the amount of existing information on any of
the subjects of his research, may find it comprised in a few volumes.
But let me quit a subject which may be considered as irrelevant to
the nature of this work; and which, if pursued, might lead into a
wide field of statement and discussion.


Means of conveyance having been provided to take Lord Amherst
and the gentlemen of his suite overland to Batavia, they set off on the
morning of the 11th June for Sirang, which is about half-way between
Anyer Point and Batavia. His Excellency, with his usual attention
to the furtherance of my pursuits, permitted me to select my own
mode of travelling. I therefore took possession of a dooly, and
accompanied by Mr. Havell, who also preferred this mode of
<!-- Leaf 57, Page: 27 -->
travelling, commenced my journey in the rear of the carriages which
conveyed the other gentlemen of the embassy. *


It was dark before I arrived at the house of Col. Yules, the resident
of the district of Sirang, from whose hospitality I obtained the
pleasure of remaining in a part of Java interesting in the highest degree
from its scenery and productions, during the stay of the Embassador
at Batavia. <


At day-light the following morning, Lord Amherst and many of
the gentlemen quitted Sirang for Batavia, leaving behind Mr. Havell
and myself.


As my stay was to be limited to a few days, I consulted with
several gentlemen at Col. Yules respecting objects of interest in the
neighbourhood of Sirang, and directed my attention to those which
were more immediately within my reach. Of these, Gunong Karang,
a volcanic mountain distant about 18 miles S. E. of Sirang,
particularly excited my curiosity, through the accounts that I received of
its magnificent crater. I therefore, at three o'clock in the afternoon
of the 13th June, left Sirang in company with Capt. Soady,
intending to sleep at the native village of Plassur Pittee, situated on its
declivity.


Our way, during the first half of the journey, lay through a plain
highly cultivated, covered with rice fields, and intersected by rivulets.
By the side of the road, at the distance of every three or four miles,
we met with small sheds, intended as stations for coolies or porters,
who relieve each other in transporting packages, or who act as bearers
of palanquins. They also serve as places of refreshment, their
neighbourhood always abounding in cocoa-nut trees and bananas; the
fruit of which, together with the areca-nut, and betel-leaf, are exposed


* A dooly is a kind of palanquin formed of bamboo, and resembling in shape a small
house. It is well defended from the weather, and is carried by four or eight men,
according to the size, who support it by transverse pieces of bamboo crossing the ends of poles
which pass along its sides. Double sets of bearers generally attend it, to render the
burden as light as possible, and they are relieved every four miles, by fresh relays.

for sale on a small table in the centre of the shed. The areca-nut,
betel-leaf, and a small quantity of slaked lime, form the favourite
masticatory of the Javanese. The better class carry them constantly
about their persons in boxes sometimes of rather elegant forms, one
of which is figured in the annexed engraving. Some of them add
to this appendage two small instruments*, with which they bruise
the ingredients for mastication before they take them into their
mouths. One of these is a small hollow cylinder, having a piston
which works within it. Having drawn back the piston, they fill the
cylinder with the areca-nut, betel-leaf, and lime, and bruise them
with an instrument shaped like a chisel, by working it about in the  
  
  
  ' These instruments are shown by figures No. 4 and 5.
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P58_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 59, Page: 29 -->
hollow of the cylinder. Having done this, they place its open end
between the lips, and forcing down the piston, drive the masticatory
into their mouths. But these instruments are, I suspect, confined to
old men, who use them as a substitute for teeth. We halted at one
of the sheds, about half-way on our journey, and partook of the
neverfailing and ever-grateful beverage in this climate, cocoa-nut juice.
This fluid is very sensibly cool when taken from a nut fresh gathered,
and as far as my experience goes, is free from any deleterious
qualities. The end of the nut in a green state, is readily cut off with a
strong knife, and the juice is drunk from the opening thus made.
The natives climb the tall tapering palms which produce this fruit,
with wonderful dexterity; oftentimes ascending them without
artificial aid, depending on their hands and feet for support. Sometimes,
however, they notch the trees, or place against them long and thick
bamboos, to which they affix a row of pegs that serve as the steps
of a ladder.


Soon after leaving this place, the road, which before was tolerably
level, became rugged, continually ascending, and sometimes very
steep. The scenery on each side was composed of hillocks speckled
with clumps of trees. At their base ran mountain torrents, in which
natives were watering their buffaloes. On our right, Gunong Karang
rose majestically in the back ground; and smoke ascending above
trees, marked the site of the village of Plassur Pittee. As we
advanced, the inequality of the ground increased, and had obliged the
natives to cut it into terraces, for the cultivation of rice. These
they had irrigated by filling up the bed of a stream at an elevated
point, where its waters were first required. Having overflown the
first, or uppermost field, it passed to a second; from a second to a
third, till it reached the lowermost, when it was led into its old
channel by a trench cut for the purpose. I was informed that the natives
obtain from their paddy fields two crops of rice annually, in the high
lands. Besides rice, they obtain two crops of esculent vegetables;
sweet potatoes, and after these, cucumbers with a species of bean.
They allow no repose to the soil, which is a rich vegetable mould
<!-- Leaf 60, Page: 30 -->
constantly watered by rains and heavy dews, and fertilised by
mountain torrents charged with the decay of vegetation, and the
mouldering of rocks. -The method of reaping in Java is the same as in many
other parts of the East: the stems of the corn are divided singly.
The instrument used by the Javanese for this purpose is shown by
Fig. 10. in the wood engraving.


Continuing our route, we entered, about eight miles short of Plassur
Pittee, an extensive forest formed of distinct woods, which were
separated from each other by plains of the richest green: over these
strewn the huts of the natives surrounded by palms contrasting
with trees of freer foliage. The natives, in their picturesque dresses,
were every where issuing with their buffaloes from the woods, or
loitering with careless indifference in their shade. The beauty of the
picture could not be surpassed; and its various parts so harmonised
together, that in their adjustment, nature seemed to have been directed
by the hand of design.


Having passed two miles of this delightful region, we turned
suddenly to the right, and soon lost all marks of a beaten track.
My companion, notwithstanding he had previously visited the
mountain, missed the path, and became entirely bewildered. Night would
probably have overtaken us in a situation where beasts of prey are
numerous*, but for the natural benevolence of a Javanese, who seeing
us from a distance, guessed our embarrassment, and hastened to our
relief. He pointed out some branches of trees which were fixed in the
ground, and made us understand, that the inhabitants of Plassur
Pittee, when informed of our intended visit, had planted them for our


* Tigers abound on the island of Java. Not far from the spot where I then was, my
companion had been obliged, some time before, to encamp for the night; when a boy
who slept near him was carried off by one of these animals, notwithstanding the
precaution of fires. I was informed by Professor Reinwardt, during my last stay in Java, that
no less than thirty persons had been destroyed by them, in the space of two months, near
the village of Buitenzorg. His Excellency Baron Van de Capellan, the present governor
of Java, fell in with three tigers whilst on a shooting excursion, about a mile from his
residence at this place. I saw the skin of one which was shot by his party.

guidance, and that we should find them continued to the village, which
was distant about three miles. Thus directed, we pursued our route
till within about a mile of our destination, when the precipitous nature
of the ground obliged us to dismount. Looking back from this spot,
at a fourth of the ascent up the mountain, we commanded a view of
a great extent of country, expanding to the computed distance of
thirty miles. The woods which we had passed seemed to be dwindled
into spots of green, and the huts of the natives were scarcely visible.


At six in the evening we reached Plassur Pittee. This village
stands on a platform that is terraced from the declivity of Gunong
Karang, which towers at its back. The summit of this mountain is
covered with thick and impenetrable woods, which, extending beyond
the village, flank it on both sides.


We were surrounded by the villagers as soon as we arrived, who
busied themselves in preparing for our accommodation and
refreshment. To defend us from the cold and damp of the evening, and to
keep off the musquitoes, they lighted fires about the hut intended
for our reception. Looking at these men armed with daggers, and
formed into groups about the fires, and reflecting that we were
defenceless in the midst of a people who had been often represented as
assassins, I felt something like alarm, and the first incident I met
with for a moment increased it. Whilst examining a lamp
suspended before the door of a hut, the natives who had been lying
around me on the ground hastily started up, and seizing a bundle of
lighted bamboos, ran towards me. My apprehension was needless.
Observing me handle the lamp, they imagined I wished for a light,
and their sudden movement was the consequence of their zeal to

please me.

On entering the hut, I found my companion seated with the Ingabi*,

at a table covered with bananas and oranges. Having added to
these some of our own stores, we soon found ourselves perfectly

at our ease. The hut consisted of three apartments, separated
from each other by bamboo mats; the centre, open at both ends, was
our sitting-room; the others, divided from it by matting, formed our
bed-rooms. A plank of wood, simply hewn from a tree, and
supported on four legs of bamboo, formed our table, and our seats were
of similar construction. Three lamps of different forms lighted our
apartment; one standing on the table consisted of a small block of
wood, in which was fixed a piece of bamboo supporting a segment of a
cocoa-nut; the second was the half of an oblong fruit hollowed in its
centre, and through its sides was passed a slip of bamboo, by
which it was suspended; the third was more complex in its
fabrication, and more elegant in its shape. Each was furnished with
cocoanut oil.


Our beds were bamboo frames, covered with mats; on these,
with our saddles for pillows, we passed the night. I suffered severely
from cold, the thermometer having fallen in the evening, between
the hours of six and twelve, from seventy-five to sixty-six degrees.
Leslie's hygrometer marked the point of extreme moisture.

At day-break we recommenced our journey to the crater of the
mountain, accompanied by natives in great numbers, part of them
being appointed as guides by the Ingabi, the others attracted by
curiosity. The ascent of the mountain from the village was
extremely steep from its commencement; and although a road had
been cut by the natives through a wood, over a narrow ridge,

between two deep ravines, its difficulties would have been
insurmountable but for the methods used to overcome its greatest
obstructions. Whenever it was very precipitous, with no projections of
the roots of trees by which to cling, strong bamboos were placed
perpendicularly in the ground on either side of the path, and branches
of trees were hung transversely between them, forming flights of steps
which, in some places, continued for fifty feet. Having ascended
for about an hour, we reached an open space, from which I had
been promised an extensive prospect, but to our great
disappointment, thick masses of cloud rolled at our feet, and hid every thing
from our sight beyond the distance of a few yards. Having refreshed
ourselves, we again advanced, and in another hour attained a part of
the mountain where a large surface of its rock was entirely exposed.
It consisted of strata very highly curved in their centre, was compact
in its texture, approached to basalt in general character, and
contained radiated zeolite. This exposed mass was on the ridge over
which we passed, and its strata had been probably bent by one of
those eruptions of the volcano which at different periods had
convulsed the mountain. The strata were parallel with the sides of the
ravines, to which the line of their disturbance was perpendicular.


The ridge over which we were ascending narrowed as we proceeded,
and the ravines on both sides proportionably enlarged, appearing
to have been the paths of lava at some distant period. Although
thickly clothed with verdure, it was easy, when the clouds
occasionally cleared, to trace their general form. They are narrow at
the commencement near the bottom of the mountain, but widen as
they ascend into immense semicircular basins. Still advancing, and
having completed a large portion of the ascent of the mountain,
we gained the verge of the crater, which it was my principal
object in this excursion to visit; and now with regret I ascertained, that
without ropes it was impossible to descend to its bottom; and that
there would not be sufficient time to despatch any of our attendants
for them. I was therefore obliged to content myself with the view I
could obtain of it from the point where I stood. Its shape is that ofa  
  
  
  F
<!-- Leaf 66, Page: 34 -->
horse-shoe, and, like the ravines, its narrowest is its lowest part.
The sides are nearly perpendicular to the apparent depth of three
hundred feet. Their upper part, to within one hundred feet of
their base, is clothed with a thick foliage, but below, quite bare.
The bottom of the crater is formed, as I afterwards ascertained, of
masses of crystallized sulphur, and of sulphur mixed with fine white
volcanic ash. At its narrowest part, which bore south from the point
where I stood, I could distinctly trace ridges, looking, at a distance,
like furrows. Smoke was issuing from it in many places, which,
rising upwards, surrounded us with a sulphureous atmosphere. Clouds
frequently rolled from the bottom to the top of the crater, and were
in perpetual oscillation, sometimes filling its whole area, and hiding
every object; then receding and leaving every part visible. The
ground shook beneath us, and appeared to be composed of little
else than the roots of trees and the decay of vegetation. The interval
separating the ravine on the right and the crater on the left, was not
more than two feet in width; but the thickness of the wood, whilst
it afforded firm handhold, prevented us from observing much danger

in our situation. I had no barometer with me, and therefore could
not accurately measure the elevation of the highest part of the verge
of the crater. Fahrenheit's thermometer stood at 68° at 11 A.M.,
when in the plains, it was at 84°. and Leslie's hygrometer* was less
than zero. Water boiled at 206°.  
  
  
  During our whole ascent we had been surrounded by interesting  
  
  
  plants. The ferns and mosses were especially beautiful. Of the former
the smaller tribes were in the greatest variety; and the tree ferns
were occasionally so abundant that they formed perfect woods
occupying a considerable space of ground, to the exclusion of other plants.
Of mosses I collected a great number; some of them of a size unusual
to their order. In a cave formed in the bare rock, before described,
I found the Polytrichum undulatum, in all respects resembling the

speak in another part of this work.
<!-- Leaf 67, Page: 35 -->
British species. It was delightful to find, so far from home, a plant
familiar to my eye, and connected in its associations with the dearest
scenes of my life.


Amongst the flowering plants, the most remarkable was the
Nepenthes distillatoria*, which the natives of the mountains call the king
of plants. They believe that the water contained in its basket-like
appendages possesses medicinal properties, and that it strengthens
the sight. This plant grows near the roots of trees, varying much in
size and appearance: in the latter particularly, from bearing, in what
I conceive to be a young state, its peculiar organs without a
corresponding leaf. I have seen specimens of the plant with few leaves
and many appendages. I generally found a great number of drowned
insects in the water of these receptacles, but could ascertain nothing
in its taste or smell that was likely to have attracted them. The same
circumstance is met with in Sarracenia adunea.


In descending the mountain I was obliged to use great caution,
as the path must always be very slippery, in consequence of the heavy
dews which fall upon the mountain; the thickness of the woods
prepreventing their evaporation. On our return it was especially so,
as it was raining heavily during our descent. I stumbled frequently,
and should have fallen more than once, but for the attention of
the natives. They followed me closely, uttered a cry at every false
step I made, and caught me by the arm whenever I was in danger.
It is impossible to do justice to the active and emulous good-nature
of these mountaineers, who were anxious to excel each other in
rendering me service. During my stay on the mountain I received
great assistance from them in all my pursuits, although they could
not comprehend their object. They were at first much amused at
my collecting plants familiar to their daily observation, yet vied
with each other in gathering them for me. If I pointed to a flower


* When in China, I received specimens of this plant from some islands in the
neighbourhood of Macao, which I could not discover to be different from those gathered on
Gunong Karang. See Note (B) in Appendix.

at a great elevation, several started to obtain it, and he who
succeeded evidently triumphed in his fortune. Neither was my presence
necessary to excite them to this benevolent activity. Not being able,
from the advance of the day, to reach the top of the mountain, I
despatched several natives to collect specimens of rocks from it;
and on their return, I was surprised to see them laden with pieces
of rock, bundles of plants, and joints of bamboo full of water
collected from hollows at the top of the mountain. This they seemed
to consider as holy, advising me to wash myself with it as a
security against danger. But I should exhaust the patience of my reader
were I to mention but a small proportion of the numerous proofs
I personally experienced of the innate principles of benevolence
that enter into the moral character of the Javanese. Not only in
the excursion of which I am now giving the narrative, but during
the whole period of my first and second visit in Java, they
repeatedly occurred to me. That their intellectual is equal to their moral
excellence, may be inferred from the specimens of their poetry
which have lately been given to the world. * Yet these are the
people who have been pursued as beasts of prey, and of whom
upwards of four hundred have been barbarously and uselessly
slaughtered f since the island of Java has been given up by the English.
Thank God, I did not hear that any of my countrymen had ever
oppressed them, but often heard, and often saw, that the Javanese
looked upon the English rather as benefactors than as masters,
and it was notorious that the name of Raffles was almost idolized
by them.


The natives whom I saw in the mountain had limbs of more elegant
shape, and greater symmetry of form, than those of the plains; and
also appeared more active in their habits.

continuance on that island, and that its horrors have been rather extenuated than aggravated,

<!-- Leaf 69, Page: 37 -->

Having reached Plassur Pittee about 5 o'clock in the evening, we
set off for Pandigalang, a village five miles to the east of the mountain;
and at this place, which was formerly famed for the manufactory of
bracelets, we passed the night.


On the following morning several natives brought different kinds
of arms and ornaments for sale, in consequence of its having been
given out by the Ingabi, the preceding evening, that I wished to
purchase some. There was, however, an evident reluctance to dispose
of them, and it was stated that those only parted from their weapons
who were embarrassed by gaming. I learned from general testimony
that the Javanese have a kind of superstitious attachment to their
arms, especially when they have descended to them from their
ancestors, or have been illustrated by use in war. Of those brought to me,
the kriss was the most remarkable. It is a dagger worn by all classes
of the natives of Java, and by the Malay tribes in its neighbourhood,
having sometimes a crooked or curved blade, and a handle very
beautifully carved. ' Its sheath is generally of wood or metal;
frequently of gold. The gold thus used is of various degrees of purity,
from an equal mixture of copper to a fineness which permits the most
delicate assay; but it is generally very thin, being a mere covering to a
case of wood. A variegated wood is also in great estimation for the
manufacture of sheaths: it has a light ground, marked either with
dark spots or veins. A knife of rather elegant form, and neatly
ornamented with silver, was also brought for sale. The natives wear these
arms in different parts of their dress, and they derive from them in
the eyes of a stranger a formidable aspect: they place them generally
in their girdles, either before or behind, and sometimes on one side.
The kriss seems formed, for a back stroke, and is easily concealed
by turning it under the fore-arm. I made a drawing of these
instruments; and specimens of those which I thought interesting from
their form or workmanship, are shown in the annexed engraving.
<!-- Leaf 71, Page: 39 -->

Gold and silver ornaments are much worn by the Javanese women,
and are very complicated in their pattern. I saw the
commencement of the manufacture of one of these, a silver belt for the waist.
The workman having beaten out the silver to the requisite dimensions,
placed it in a bed of wax; he then, with a small hammer and chisel,
began to trace the outline of the pattern by successive indentations;
and in this simple but tedious manner the work was to be finished.


Before I left Pandigalang, my friends the mountaineers brought
some splendid specimens of native sulphur, which they had collected
from the bottom of the crater of Gunong Karang. With it they also
brought me a specimen of the Goramy*, a fish found in many of the
rivers of Java, and celebrated for its flavour. It is beautiful in its
hues and singular in its form. The ground colour is orange, that
of the back a dark bronze, which passes in undulating lines over its
sides. Its form is a roundish oval, the head short, with a somewhat
recurved snout; but the animal is particularly distinguished by the
prolongation of its pectoral fins into thread-like processes, several
inches in length. The native princes of Java keep these fish alive in
large quantities in reservoirs near their dwellings. Its general
characters are well marked in the annexed engraving.

We returned to Sirang on the evening of the 15th, and on the
following morning made an excursion to a place called Epetan, about
eighteen miles to the north of Sirang, to see some mineral springs.
These springs are in the midst of a jungle on the right hand side of
the road from Sirang to Batavia, and the country for many miles around
is a perfect flat, On approaching them I smelt the sulphureous gas,
which they throw out in immense quantities. They are situated on
a piece of barren ground about fifty yards square, composed of a
hard rock, which seemed to have been formed by deposition
from the springs. In the midst of this space were several small
pools of water in violent commotion. They so exactly exhibited
the appearance of boiling, that I immersed my hand in them with
considerable caution, and scarcely credited my feeling when I found
them of the temperature of the surrounding atmosphere. The
central pool was the largest, having an area of eight or ten feet.
The water bubbled up from several parts of its surface. For the
sake of ascertaining the cause of these phænomena, I walked in
and discovered its greatest depth" to be about three feet. Its
bottom was formed of rock, broken into masses of different shapes.
On searching immediately under the place where the agitation of
the water was most violent I found a small funnel-shaped aperture,
the lower part of which was not more than an inch in diameter.
Through this, sulphuretted hydrogen rushed up in such quantity and
with so much force, that I could with great difficulty keep my hand
close to its orifice.


On examining the sensible properties of the water on the spot, I
found it to be of a dirty white colour, containing a considerable
portion of earthy matter in suspension. The smell was that of
Harrogate-water. The soil on the margin, and at the bottom of these
pools, is soft and of a yellowish grey colour on the surface; but a
few inches beneath, it becomes of a rocky hardness, and red. At
the distance, however, of two or three feet from the pools, the
surface itself is equally hard, but of a blue colour, and bearing evident
marks of having been at some distant period, the seat of agitated

water. A loud bubbling noise is distinctly heard, on placing the
ear close to any part of the barren spot in which they are situated.
The natives believe that the water possesses medicinal properties, and
that it is especially efficacious in cutaneous disease. *


On my return from the Springs, I made an excursion to Bantam,
which is seven miles to the north of Sirang, for the sake of obtaining
some specimens of the large bat of Java, which resort to groves in its
neighbourhood.


Bantam differs but little in appearance from other native towns of
Java, consisting for the most part of long streets formed by the
huts of the natives, surrounded on all sides by plantations of
fruittrees, of which the cocoa-nut and the banana are the most
conspicuous. Passing through a lane formed of these dwellings, my attention
was attracted by the firing of a musket and the sound of music; and
on looking into an enclosure surrounding a cottage I saw a number of
natives assembled, some of whom were gaudily dressed. As soon as
I was perceived by them, they invited me in, not, as I had imagined,
to witness a marriage-festival, but the rite of circumcision. I was
ushered into a small square room, full of people. A wide bench
passed from one side of it to the other, on which were spread three
mats covered with plantain-leaves; and over these hung as many
curtains formed into small tents. This preparation had been made
for the reception of three little boys about five years of age, who
underwent in my presence the operation of circumcision; which was
performed by a native surgeon with great dexterity and dispatch, f
On the completion of each operation a musket was discharged and


* At the period of my visit, I was annoyed by some troublesome ulcers from the bites of
musquitoes, which had covered my hands for several days; but they healed immediately,
after having bathed them with the water of these pools.

music played. The little patients evinced no signs of pain, and
immediately after their respective operations were conveyed to their
separate plantain-leaves, which were to be renewed as often as
coolness and cleanliness required. The parents of the children
considered the presence of a stranger on this occasion as a propitious
omen.


Leaving this place, I paid a visit to the Sultan of Bantam, to whom,
being ill, I wished to tender my medical assistance. On my way I
passed the ruins- of the palace of his predecessors, lying in
shapeless confusion, and possessing no other interest than arose from the
beautiful ferns * that every where covered them. The present
residence of the Sultan is an old Dutch house on the banks of a canal
which nearly encompasses it. In front is a court-yard, containing
at the time of my visit several old-fashioned European carriages; cages
with different birds and animals placed against its walls; and vases
of water filled with fish standing without order in different parts
of its area. I was received at the door of the house by the Regent
of Bantam, and conducted by him into a long room hung round with
the arms of the Sultan : spears, swords, and daggers, glittering with
diamonds and gold, hung against bare and mouldering walls, and
contrasted with a few mutilated chairs of European manufacture.


A groan directed me to the dying Sultan, who lay stretched on a
small pallet at one end of the room, supported in the arms of an
interesting looking woman, and attended by two of his male relatives.
Although the last struggles of life agitated his frame, he had sufficient
strength to grasp my hand, and by a motion of his head to decline my
assistance: it would have been unavailing, as he died a few hours after
I left him.

On quitting this house of mourning, I hastened to a grove, where
I expected to find many of the great bats of Java, which had been
represented to me as Vampires, and which in look and ferocity might
be supposed to appropriate the fables of those frightful beings. I
had often seen, since my arrival in Java, flying in the day-time at
a great elevation, an animal making a noise so resembling the cawing
of a crow, that at first I mistook it for a species of this bird. I now
saw many of its species suspended in large clusters with their heads
downward from the branches of trees; and so firmly did they adhere,
that although I fired at them, and must have destroyed two or three,
they did not fall. By throwing large stones, I obliged them to quit
their resting places and to take wing, many of them with young
ones clinging to their breasts. They then hovered about, screeched
violently, and, flapping their enormous wings, circled close over my
head, reminding me of the harpies of antiquity. After some trials,
I succeeded in shooting two, a male and female: the male being the
larger. Nothing could be more hideous than their aspect. Their
bodies, covered with long hair, resemble that of a fox in colour,
smell, and form, but that of a full grown rat in size. They are
suspended between wings, similar in texture to those of a common bat,
but extending five feet from one extremity to the other. The tail,
which is four inches long, is also like that of the fox, and is enclosed
by the membrane uniting the hinder extremities. The female, which
was only wounded in one of its wings, endeavoured^to strike me
with the other, screeching violently at tlie same time, and grinning
horribly. When left to itself it exerted its fury on the wounded limb,
which it smashed with its teeth.


The great bat of Java *, as far as I could ascertain, is not
carnivorous, but is much dreaded for the destruction it occasions to fruit
trees, whole orchards of which it denudes of their blossoms. The.


* The great bat of Java bears the same name as that of New Holland, flying-fox. It
also in some respects resembles it, but differs from it in having an undivided membrane
between its hinder extremities.  
  
  
  G 2
<!-- Leaf 78, Page: 44 -->
stomach also connects it with herbivorous animals *; and that it
does not feed on mice, as supposed by some authors, is rendered
probable by its habit of flying at great heights. It is often seen in
the day-time passing over the Straits of Sunda in large flocks. This
fact is stated by Mr. Marsden f, in his History of Sumatra, and has
been corroborated by the experience of Capt. Ross, of the
EastIndia Company's ship Discovery, who assured me that he had
witnessed it.


On my return from Bantam to Sirang, I passed a large house
situated on a small island in the midst of a bog, which the legends
of the natives had peopled with formidable serpents. The house
was said to be the prison for the refractory or unfaithful wives of the
Sultan of Bantam. The effluvia of the marsh would probably be
more destructive than its monsters to the inmates of such a dwelling.


On reaching Sirang, I was gratified by finding that during my
absence a skin of the large snake of Java, measuring nine feet in
length without the head, had been brought in. It had been taken
from a snake that had been killed in the act of swallowing a kid, but
two days before. This serpent, often met with in Java twenty feet
in length, inhabits woody and swampy grounds, but sometimes
approaches the huts of the natives, and makes great havoc amongst
their poultry when no larger animals fall in its way. In its attacks


* The stomach consists of four divisions. The first is a sort of pouch, formed by
the expansion of the œsophagus. The second is distinctly separated from the first, by
a muscular contraction, but is equal to one half of the whole stomach : it contracts into a
gut-like pouch for nearly a third of its length, before it terminates in the third division,
with which it communicates by a small muscular orifice. The two last divisions are
equal to about one fourth of the whole stomach; of this proportion the third division
occupies full three fifths, the fourth division being very small, but thicker in its coats than
any of the others. It communicates with the third division, and the duodenum by very
contracted orifices. I know not whether the bat of Java be of the same species as the
one dissected by Sir Everard Home, the stomach of which has been described by him
in his work on Comparative Anatomy; but the structure of this organ in both appears
to be the same.  
  
  
  f History of Sumatra, p. 118.
<!-- Leaf 79, Page: 45 -->
upon them, it resembles the Boa constrictor of authors; destroying by
the force of its muscular folds deer, goats, wild hogs, and sheep;
which it gorges whole.


It has been stated by an author * often quoted for his authenticity,
that " he bought one of these snakes of a hunter, and on dissecting it
found in its body an entire middle-aged stag covered with its skin;
that he purchased another which had swallowed a wild goat in spite of
its large horns; and that he drew from the stomach of a third, a
porcupine armed with its quills:" he also mentions that " a pregnant
woman was swallowed by one of these animals." f


Till recently such tales have been considered fabulous, and yet
there can be no doubt but those who have lived much in torrid
climates must frequently have witnessed corresponding facts. The
description I shall presently give of the habits of a large Java snake,
which I saw alive at Batavia, and afterwards examined both alive and
dead on board the Cæsar, will be sufficiently illustrative of its power
of destroying large quadrupeds. That it is equally capable of
destroying and prone to attack a human being, I could gain no certain
evidence in Java. It will appear, however, from the following
statement, that man himself is not always secure against his formidable

power.


Captain Ross (whom I have just mentioned), while in his ship off
the island of Celebes, was visited by a canoe from the shore,
containing two Malays, and the mangled body of a man, the bones of
which were mostly broken : the arms especially being dreadfully
crushed. The eyes appeared to be starting from the head, in
consequence of its having been violently compressed. On enquiring the
cause of these appearances, the Malays informed Captain Ross,
that having landed to fish along shore, they had left the canoe in

charge of the poor fellow whose body he saw; that they had told
him to be on his guard against the large snakes which are often
seen on the skirts of the wood near the sea; that they had not
left him long before they were alarmed by his cries, and on
hastening to his assistance, found him enveloped in the folds of a large
serpent; that he was dead before they could destroy the snake,
which did not quit its hold on their approach. They then produced
the head of the snake, which Captain Ross examined. It was very
small when considered in relation to the extraordinary power of the
animal, and capability of swallowing; for it would doubtless have
gorged the body of the man, unless prevented by the appearance of
his companions. Itdid not measure more than eight inches in its
greatest diameter. The man had evidently been seized by one of
the wrists, as it bore the impressions of the snake's teeth.


That the size of the head of a snake bears no proportion to the
magnitude of an animal which it is capable of swallowing, will be
evident from an account that I shall now give of a specimen, whose
head measured in its greatest longitudinal diameter five inches, and
in its greatest transverse diameter four inches and a half. The
internal width between the two portions of the lower jaw, within
which its prey must have passed to its stomach, was rather more
than an inch and a half. This animal, which the drawing correctly
represents, measured eighteen feet in length, and eighteen inches
in its largest circumference. Its predominant colours were greenish
brown, with a purplish tinge, and yellow and black. Greenish
brown, speckled with a brownish yellow, was the colour of its back,
and bright yellow, speckled with black, the colour of its belly. It
was a male.


This animal, although permitted, when I saw him at Batavia, to
leave his cage, and go into an open space, was seldom disposed to
avail himself of this liberty, and it was often necessary to drag him
out, and to irritate him repeatedly, before he could be induced to

and silently along the ground, and so exactly harmonised in colour
with the soil * over which he was passing, that unless watched, he
might easily have been overlooked. Whilst at full length, he might
be approached with safety, as he had not then the power of darting;
but when he reared himself on his folds, and put his head into a
vibratory motion, he had the greatest command of his powers, and exhibited
the most threatening aspect. This attitude he usually assumed after
he had been some time from his cage, and all who were near him
involuntarily drew back. A live duck being brought to him, he felt it for
a moment with his forked tongue, and then seizing it by the breast,
endeavoured to wind his folds about its body, which being too small
to suffer from their compression, he threw the weight of one of his
folds upon its neck, and strangled it. When it was dead, he
gradually withdrew himself, and taking it head foremost into his mouth,
sucked it down his throat. But a duck was only a mouthful to him;
a goat being his usual meal. On board the Cæsar he swallowed
two, which were given to him in his cage, at the interval of a
month from each other. As soon as the goat was within his reach,
he raised his head above his coils, and having contemplated his prey
a few seconds, felt it with his tongue. The goat did not appear to be
much alarmed, as he examined the snake closely, smelling him over
with great deliberation. The snake having withdrawn his head a
short distance, made a sudden dart at the throat of the goat, which
received him on its horns, and obliged him for an instant to retreat.
He then made a second dart, and seizing the goat by the leg, pulled it
violently down, and insinuated his folds with momentary rapidity
about its body, squeezing it at the same time with all the force he
could bring to bear. But even in this instance, the animal was too
small to suffer their whole compressing effect, and he was obliged to

the province of Venezuela, seated themselves on a snake, which they mistook for an old
trunk of a tree, and which to their great astonishment began to move ! ! ! Hist. Natur

<!-- Leaf 84, Page: 50 -->
77destroy the goat much in the same manner as he had the duck, by
throwing the weight of his body on its neck. The goat was eight
minutes dying, but was so entirely overwhelmed by the power of the
snake, that it could not even struggle.


The snake did not attempt to change his posture for some minutes
after the goat was dead. At length he gradually slackened his
folds, and then disengaged them one by one, with great caution
and slowness, as if to ascertain whether the goat retained any power
of motion; and having entirely disentangled himself, prepared to
swallow it by placing himself opposite to its head, and feeling it with
his mouth. While doing this, saliva flowed abundantly over his jaws,
but he made no attempt to besmear his prey. In a few minutes he
took its nose into his mouth, and endeavoured to draw the head after
it: but this appeared to be no easy task. The dilatation of his throat
seemed to begin with difficulty, as he was at least one-third of the
time consumed in gorging the goat, in getting down the head and
horns. These diverged at a considerable angle, and were four inches
in length. Having conquered them, he grappled with the shoulders,
which he was some time in mastering; but readily overcame the
remainder of the body. In drawing the goat into his swallow, he
appeared to work himself unto it, opening his mouth as wide as
possible, and forcing it onwards. Whatever progress he thus made,
was preserved by strong recurved teeth which permitted the animal
to pass down his throat, but prevented its regurgitation without his
will. The act of swallowing was also much aided, I suspect, by the
pressure of the air on the goat's body, as a deep inspiration
accompanied every successive attempt to draw it down his throat. * He
was two hours and five minutes in gorging the whole animal.


The appearance of the snake, when in the act of swallowing the
shoulders of the goat, was very hideous. He seemed to be
suffering strangulation. His cheeks, immensely dilated, appeared to

grounds about my house. One evening early in July, hearing a noise, I
went out, and discovered that the snake had left his harbour under the
boards of a stable where he generally kept, and having entered a small
shed in which some fowls were at roost, had contrived to sweep eleven
from the perch, which he afterwards destroyed by pressing them
between his folds. Then taking them one by one, head foremost
into his mouth, swallowed the whole in twenty minutes. The largest
animal that he ate while in my possession was a calf, which he killed
and gorged in two hours and twenty minutes. He preferred goats
to any other animals, but was also fond of calves, sheep, and fowls;
he never attacked dogs, cats, or pigs. Of these last, indeed, he
seemed to be in dread, for whenever one was presented to him, he
retired to a corner, and coiled himself up with his head undermost.
If regularly fed with animals not larger than a duck, he ate readily
every day; but after the meal of a goat, refused food for a month."


In the different accounts given by authors of the destruction of large
****> J o
animals by serpents, much discrepancy of statement exists respecting
the breaking of their bones. Whilst some have declared that their
cracking has been heard at a considerable distance *, others have
produced instances of the bodies of large animals in which no "
ossifraction" had taken place, having been found in the stomachs of serpents, f
The bones of the animals swallowed by Capt. Heyland's snake were
not fractured, as far as " a looker-on could discover;" and although
many of the by-standers conceived that they heard the breaking of
the bones of the goat which he swallowed on board the Cæsar, I am
disposed to attribute much to the force of their imagination. I
listened attentively, and heard only the snapping of his scales as they
slipped over each other during his manifold movements. On opening
him after death, I found indeed a portion of one of the goat's
legs which seemed to have been fractured; but as the same kind of
appearance might have been the consequence of its partial digestion,
it is not to be depended on. The truth perhaps is, that the bones of

  H 2
<!-- Leaf 86, Page: 52 -->
those animals only are broken which are very disproportionate to the
size of the serpent which destroys them.


The statements made by different writers respecting the bulk and
form of many of the animals destroyed and swallowed by snakes,
have been received with more incredulity than they perhaps deserve.
So frightful a spectacle as that exhibited by a buffalo or a tiger
struggling with an enormous serpent, may have exalted the imagination of
its beholders, and have led them into hyperbolical description; but
there is nothing in the mere fact which is contrary to our knowledge
of animal power and function. Without going into an elaborate
argument to show that the quantity and kind of muscular fibre
possessed by a snake twenty or thirty feet in length, must necessarily
enable it to perform the feats which have been related of it, I may
remark, that the power of the snake, in fracturing the bones of
animals by its muscular folds, gives less occasion for astonishment than
the removal of the limb of a man by one effort of the maxillary
muscles of a shark. And whoever has considered the dilatable powers
of a living muscular and membranous bag, will feel no surprise that a
goat was swallowed by a snake whose gullet measured six feet six
inches, and stomach one foot nine inches, in length; nor will he
hesitate to believe, that such a cavity was capable of containing a
much larger animal, or that the corresponding organ in a snake of
greater dimensions might contain one equal in bulk to any of those
which according to some writers have been ingulfed in the entrails of
serpents. The difficulty lies in conceiving, how large animals pass
the narrow orifice between the jaws, which confine the entrance of

the swallow; but this vanishes when the structure of the part is
carefully examined. The two bones composing the lower jaw (I take my
description from the great snake of Java) are not in contact in
front, nor united by an unyielding medium, but are separated by
a loose dilatable membrane, and connected with the upper jaw
by intermaxillary bones *', which permit an enlargement of the cavity


* This structure is also pointed out by Mr. Corse Scott, in thc Edinburgh Philosophical
Transactions.
<!-- Leaf 87, Page: 53 -->
os the mouth by yielding laterally during deglutition. The scales of
the throat also admit of considerable dilation, as they are much more
remote from each other than any others in the body, and immediately
under the mouth are separated by a naked expansible membrane.


I cannot take leave of Java and its animals without saying a few
words respecting some of the lizard tribe, which, although very
interesting in their habits, have not undergone a very close investigation,
and have been very seldom and very slightly described. They press
however, more frequently than is always agreeable, even upon the
notice of a mere passing visitor in Java. At the approach of
evening, a small species which feed on insects, cover the walls, and pillars
of houses, and may be seen after their prey in all directions. A
stranger cannot at first behold them without some degree of aversion,
but soon looks on them with favour when he finds in them the
enemies of the musquitoes. This species of Lizard, which seldom
grows beyond the length of five or six inches, may be called the
house Gecko of Java, and is perhaps the Chichalc of* Sumatra.
It belongs to the subdivision of the genus Gecko, which the
celebrated Cuvier bas called Hemi-dactyles, in having the disk which
covers the base of its toes'divided into a double row of imbricated
plates, and in the position of their second phalanges, f But it differs
from the described species of this subdivision in wanting a claw to
the great toe. J It is of a light brownish grey colour, and is covered,
excepting under the tail, with very small scales, and is without
tubercles : under the tail the scales are large and imbricated. The
scales when examined with a lens, are found to owe their brownish
colour to very minute dark-coloured points. It has a rank of pores
extending down the inside of each thigh as low as the knee.

Geckos of this species possess something of the property of the
Cameleon. One of them, which dropped from the ceiling on a table
before me, was immediately imprisoned in an inverted tumbler. On
falling, it was nearly white, but assumed in a few minutes a deeper
hue, and at length almost took the colour of the mahogany on which
it rested.


This lizard is very different from the large gecko of Java, of which
I have a specimen now in my possession. And the latter does not,
as has been supposed, correspond in its characters with the Tokaie of
authors, also arranged by Cuvier under his subdivision Hemi-dactyles;
as it has only one row of transverse imbricated plates covering the
base of its spreading toes, and will therefore fall under the subdivision
Platy-dactyles. *


The following characters are taken from one of the species, which
measures eleven inches in length, and weighs 1420 grains. It is
of a lead colour marbled with red, on the back and tail, and is
of a bluish white tinged with red, on the belly. Its back to the
end of the tail is covered with conical tubercles in longitudinal
series. These are prominent, acute, and nearly erect on the
hinder part of the head, but on the back and upper part of the tail
are compressed and directed backwards. Its scales on the head and
back are small, round, and disseminated; on the belly are small,
oval, and imbricated; under the tail are large, square, and
imbricated in a band-like manner. It has a row of large pores before the
anus. Its great toes are without claws. These characters bring it
very near, if they do not identify it with the gecko of Ceylon, the
gecko a gouttelettes of Daudin, figured in Seba.-f
Bontius has stated, that an animal answering in all its characters to
the one which I have described, is notorious for its poisonous touch
and deadly bite.

denounces as " scelesti veneni propinatores" poison their arrows by
besmearing them with the blood and saliva of the gecko, and
obtain the latter by a method which would suit the rites of a
Shakespearean witch. He states, that having suspended the enraged
animal by the tail, they collect a yellow viscid liquor which it pours
from its jaws, and having dried it in the sun, use it as a deadly
poison; and by daily feeding the animal in this situation, keep it
alive, and excite it to secrete its peculiar venom for several months. J

"Whether any of the formidable properties attributed to this animal
be really possessed by it, I took some pains to ascertain, and found
that they were generally discredited amongst Europeans; but
obtained no facts that could place the question at rest: it is said
to be seldom caught and with great difficulty.


Like the house gecko, it has the power of walking, by a
peculiar structure of its feet, against its gravity in an inverted
position upon the smoothest surface. * It usually inhabits the hollows
of decayed trees, and seldom comes forth till dark, when it
occasionally enters the interior of houses, spreading alarm by its
peculiar note amongst those who believe in its venomous powers. To
every one indeed, and especially to a stranger, it is a disgusting animal.
Its large head, capacious mouth, projecting eyes, and tuberculated
body, give it a hideous aspect, and occurring to the recollection when
its shrill voice is heard in the stillness of the night, excites no
agreeable sensations. The first time that I slept at Sirang I was awakened
by a singular guttural sound, followed by the loud enunciation of the
syllables geck-6o, repeated three or four times, and which having
ceased for a few minutes, were again and again renewed. It was
in vain to seek for the intruder. The animal, although seeming to
be within a few feet, was probably without the house on an old tree,
or if in the room, he fled before light and noise, but renewed his
interruption when all was again quiet.


Another gecko, about eight inches long, also from Java, and of
which I received a specimen, with many other obligations, from
Professor Reinwardt, differs from the large gecko in being of a
lead colour marbled with white, but resembles it in the form and

  CHAPTER III.

On the 21st of June, the Ambassador and his suite having again
embarked on board the Alceste, she got under weigh from Batavia Roads
accompanied by the General Hewitt, (the Lyra having sailed some
days before,) and prosecuting her voyage, fell in, on the 9th of July,
with the Orlando frigate, Capt. Clavill.


From this vessel, which had carried out from England
intelligence of the Embassy to China, we expected to receive some
interesting information respecting the disposition of the Chinese
towards us; and were glad to learn that tidings of the Embassy
had been favourably received by them. Capt. Clavill also informed
us, that Sir George Staunton * and some gentlemen who were to
accompany him on the Embassy had embarked on board the Discovery,
one of the East-India Company's cruisers, and in company with the
Investigator, a similar description of vessel, and the Lyra, had sailed
for the Lemma Islands, there to wait for the Alceste. On receiving
this information we steered for the place of rendezvous.


For some days before we fell in with the Orlando, we had been
sailing on seas liable to those tremendous gales called by the Chinese
Typhoons, and had therefore watched with great anxiety every change
in the appearance of the sky, and every variation of the barometer.
But we experienced nothing to excite our apprehension till the evening
of the 9th of July, when the sky exhibited such novel though brilliant
appearances, as led us to fear that they would be followed by
formidable changes of weather. The course of the sun, as it sunk beneath
the horizon, was marked by a vivid glory expanding into paths of
light of the most beautiful hues. They did not in the least resemble
the pencils of rays which are often seen streaking the sky at sun-set,
but were composed of sheets of glowing pink, which diverging at

be bursting, and his windpipe projected three inches beyond his
jaws. The horns of the goat, which had advanced only a few inches
down his swallow, protruded so much, that I expected them every
instant to penetrate through the intervening membrane of the scales,
which they separated from each other. After the goat was down, he
scarcely moved from the posture he was in during his last act of
deglutition, but fell into a semi-torpid state, from which no
irritation could rouse him for several days. At this time he
measured three feet in his greatest circumference, having doubled
his ordinary diameter. The goat's body underwent no visible
diminution of bulk or consistence by the action of the snake's folds, but
seemed to pass down his throat in an entire state.


This snake having died on his way to England, forty days after
swallowing a second goat, I opened him with the view of observing his
internal structure, and of ascertaining, if possible, the cause of his
death. On the deck of a ship, and surrounded by a number of eager,
but restless observers, I could not make the examination with all the
precision I wished, but succeded in obtaining the dimensions of some of
the principal viscera, and found that their magnitude generally
corresponded with the external proportions of the body. The
lungs consisted of two lobes, closely attached to his ribs; the left
being three feet three inches, and the right one foot ten inches in
length. The heart was about the size of a goose's egg. The
æsophagus was six feet six inches long, and the stomach one foot nine
inches : the breadth of the latter when opened, and gently expanded,
was one foot. The intestines measured five feet six inches in length.
The liver consisted of two lobes, each lobe being three feet long.
The gall-bladder was the size of the heart, and full of a green viscid
bile. Each of the kidnies was a foot in length. The spleen consisted
of a large number of loosely-connected dark-coloured conglobate
glands.

8


The coats of the stomach were very thick and muscular, and thrown
into a variety of folds. Its cesophageal and intestinal orifices were
very contracted, and the latter would scarcely allow theintroducu
<!-- Leaf 94, Page: 50 -->
tion of my little finger. The coats of the intestines, in a contracted
state, near their communication with the stomach, were an inch in
thickness.


On opening the stomach, the cause of death at once appeared,
in myriads of worms which had destroyed its internal coats in
several places. These, of a dark red-colour, and varying from two to
four inches in length, were about the twentieth part of an inch in
their greatest diameter, and tapered to both extremities. They had
collected in throngs of ten or twenty, in different parts of the
stomach, and having attacked together particular spots, had formed several
round holes. These, after penetrating to the peritoneal coat, took
an oblique direction; and in some places were situated in the
centre of tubercles formed by the deposition of coagulated lymph.


Of the goat I only found the shells of the horns full of hair, and
a portion of the bone of one of the fore legs. The lower part of
the intestines contained a light yellowish excrement, which had very
little odour, and resembled chalk in consistence.


This animal evidently belongs to that subdivision of the genus Boa
which has been named Pytho by Daudin. The arrangement of the
scales on the under part of the tail, is accurately represented in the
lower figure of the annexed engraving. In the Appendix f, I have
attempted a description of him, which I hope will fix his species.


In addition to the foregoing description, taken from my own
observation, I obtained the following facts respecting his habits, from
the politeness of Capt. Heyland, who possessed him for several
months in Java, and which I cannot do better than give nearly in
his own words. " The animal was brought to me early in January,
1813, and did not from that time taste food till the July following.
During this period, he generally drank a quart of water daily, and
frequently passed a thick yellow excrement. The man who brought
him stated, that he had been seen to eat a hog-deer* the day
before he had been taken. He was allowed to be at liberty in the

<!-- Leaf 97, Page: 59 -->
equal distances from the sun's disk, darted upwards from the horizon,
diminishing in intensity of colour, till they vanished in the azure of
the surrounding atmosphere. In the intervals between these, the
sky was of a clear green, spotted with small masses of dark cloud.
Our alarm was increased by a slight fall of the barometer, but it was
groundless; the wind continued steady, and the sails which had
been furled were again spread to a favourable breeze, that enabled
us to join Sir George Staunton off the Great Lemma Island on the
following morning.


The Lemma Islands appeared to possess sufficient botanical and
geological interest, to make me very desirous of an opportunity of
examining them; but as they afforded no shelter or convenient
watering place for the squadron, our stay was too short to admit of
my landing. I was enabled, however, to form some opinion of their
structure through the kindness of my friend Capt. Hall of the Lyra,
who sent me specimens of coarse granite, approaching to sienite, and
quartz that he had taken from them, and which he informed me
entered largely into their composition.


But although unable to explore the productions of the land,
I was rather unpleasantly convinced of the reputed property of
one of those of the sea. Whilst employed in collecting some
seaweed floating about the ship, I observed a species of Physalia,
so small and transparent that I at first mistook it for an air-bubble;
but on catching it in my hand was soon convinced of my error, for
wrapping its long tendrils round one of my fingers it stung like a
nettle, but with much more severe effect. In about five minutes the
pain in my finger abated, but an uneasy sensation extended up the
inside of my arm, which soon terminated in an aching pain in the
arm-pit, accompanied by a sense of restriction in my chest: within
fifteen minutes all uneasiness ceased. The manner in which the
animal produces these effects is, I believe, unexplained; but it is
not improbable that they are occasioned by a peculiar poison, secreted
by it, and contained in a glutinous matter which covers its tendrils;
as this, when applied to the skin, apart from the animal, excites a
smarting pain.  
  
  
  i 2
<!-- Leaf 98, Page: 60 -->

The inhabitants of the Lemma Islands who came off to us in
their boats were of a light copper colour, and very athletic : they
managed their well constructed bamboo vessels with great dexterity.
In the evening the squadron weighed and stood for Hong-kong, one
of the Ladrone Islands, distant from the Great Lemma sixteen
miles in a N. E. direction, off which it anchored at ten o'clock in the

evening.

Looking from the deck of the Alceste early on the following

morning, I found that we were in a sound formed by some small
islands, by which it was land-locked in every direction, and of which
Hong-kong is the principal. As seen from the ship, this island was
chiefly remarkable for its high conical mountains, rising in the centre,
and for a beautiful cascade which rolled over a fine blue rock into the  
  
  
  ♦

sea. I took advantage of the first watering boat to visit the shore,
and made one of these mountains and the waterfall the principal
objects of my visit.


This mountain, the highest on the island, is, according to Capt.
Ross, who has measured it, about one thousand five hundred feet
above the level of the sea, and is composed of trap approaching to
basalt in the compactness of its structure. In ascending it, I followed
the course of a delightful stream which rises near its summit, and
found by its side a number of interesting plants; amongst them the
Beckia chinensis, Myrtus tomentosus, in abundance, and in full flower,
Melastoma quinquenervia, two other species of the same genus, several
orchideous plants, of which I could only determine the Limodorum
striatum; the Rubus moluccus of Rumphius, moluccanus of Wildenow;
a variety of ferns, but not a single moss of any description. The
general surface of the mountain, and indeed of every part of the island
of Hong-kong that I was able to visit, is remarkably barren, although
in the distance it appears fertile, from a fern which I believe to be
the Polypodium trichotomum of Kæmpfer *, which supplies the place  
  
  
  * Icones Kæmpferi. Banks.
<!-- Leaf 99, Page: 61 -->
of other plants. I was unable to reach the summit of the mountain
in consequence of the excessive heat, which at eight o'clock in the
morning raised the thermometer in the shade to 83°, whilst the sun's
rays, to which I necessarily exposed myself, darted through an
unclouded atmosphere with an almost intolerable effect, and raised the
quicksilver to 120°. I ascended about one thousand feet, and returned
by a path which passed over a small hill, or rather mound, differing
in structure from all the rocks in its neighbourhood, being composed
of a very friable stone of a reddish white colour, much resembling
disintegrated felspar.


On reaching the shore, I examined the rocks by the water-fall,
where they are exposed in large surfaces, and found them
composed of basaltic trap, exhibiting in some places a distinct
stratification, in others a confused columnar arrangement. It is also
divided into distinct, well defined rhomboidal masses, separated from
each other by very obvious seams, in which I frequently found cubic
crystals of iron pyrites. Having laden myself with all the specimens
of plants and rocks, which I had the means of carrying, I returned
on board the Alceste.


At day-light the following morning, 1 again visited the land, and
directed my researches to a small island separated from Hong-kong
by a channel not more than a hundred yards wide. It afforded
me very few plants except the Polypodium trichotomum, but it
presented several geological facts of much interest. This island,
which has no name on charts, rises not more than forty feet above
the sea, does not exceed three hundred yards in its largest, or one
hundred in its smallest diameter, and is entirely composed of two kinds
of rock, granite and basalt. Their junction exhibits some curious
facts. On the north side of the island, where this is most obvious,
it is occasioned by a dyke of basalt passing upwards through the
granite, and spreading over it. This dyke rises from a body of basalt
which stretches beneath the granite in a north-westerly direction, and
vanishes beneath the surface of the sea. It is not in immediate
contact with the granite, but is separated from it by three narrow veins
<!-- Leaf 100, Page: 62 -->
which interpose between them, and follow the dyke through its whole
extent. The width of each of these veins does not exceed four inches;
that of the basaltic dyke is as many feet. The veins are of three kinds :
1st, a compound of granite and basalt mixed together in an
indeterminate and confused manner; 2dly, pure felspar; and 3dly, a sort
of porphyry, composed of very perfect crystals of felspar in a basaltic
base. The veins of pure felspar and of porphyry were separated
with ease from each other, and from the neighbouring rocks; but
the felspar and basalt in mass, which was intimately combined with
the basaltic dyke, could only be separated from it with great force.
Near the line of junction of the granite with the basalt, I found
masses of the latter imbedded in the former. * I lamented much
that I could spend but two hours in the investigation of these facts,
but it would have been hazardous to have given more time to them,
as the Alceste was expected to sail early that morning.


I may now be expected to give some description of the scenery
and inhabitants of Hong-kong, but of either I have little to say.
Its scenery is composed of barren rocks, deep ravines, and
mountain-torrents, but presents few characters of a very picturesque
description. Of its inhabitants none were seen but some poor and
weather-beaten fishermen, spreading their nets, and drying the
produce of their toils on the rocks which supported their miserable
mud-huts. Its cultivation corresponded with the apparent state and

killas were imbedded in the granite.

<!-- Leaf 101, Page: 63 -->
number of its population. Patches of rice, small plantations of yams,
and a little buck-wheat, were all their visible means of vegetable
support.


Hong-kong sound is represented by my naval friends as affording
admirable shelter for ships of any burden; but its description in this
point of view does not fall within my province.


His Excellency, during our stay here, received despatches from
Macao, with the Emperor of China's reply to a report made by the
Viceroy of Canton, relating to the expected arrival of the British
Embassy, from which he learnt that orders had been issued to the
Viceroy of Pe-tchee-lee, and other high Mandarins who were likely
to have any communication with the mission, to receive us " in a
liberal, gracious, safe, and suitable manner."*


Elated with this auspicious intelligence, we sailed from Hong-kong
on the 13th of July for the Yellow Sea. The south-west monsoon
favoured our progress till the 20th, when, being off the coast of Corea,
the wind shifted to the northward, and brought with it large flights
of Libellulœ. It continued variable, but not unfavourable, during the
remainder of the voyage to the gulf of Pe-tchee-lee; and although
we frequently experienced severe thunder and lightning, nothing
approaching to a gale of wind interrupted our agreeable progress
through a smooth sea. Neither did we meet with any of those thick
fogs described by the historians of the former Embassy, whose tract
we followed as far as the streights of Formosa. These we entered
on the 15th, and on the 16th passed a small island not correctly
laid down in any chart, and which was ascertained to be in latitude
25° N., and in longitude 119° 32'E. On the 17th we cleared these
streights, shaping our course well off the land, and on the 18th passed
the Chusan Islands. On the 21st we made some islands off the coast


Corea, and on the 26th anchored for the night amidst the
Meea-tau Islands, which exhibited a distinct stratification, and appeared  
  
  
  * See Edict I. in Appendix, E.
<!-- Leaf 102, Page: 64 -->
to be of a schistose structure. I examined the soil brought up by
the anchor in their neighbourhood, and found it to contain ten per
cent, of lime; the residue was clay coloured with iron. Early in the
morning of the 27th, we passed between two of them in twelve
fathom water, entered the gulf of Pe-tchee-lee, and anchored on
the 28th in five fathoms, fifteen miles from the mouth of the Pei-ho.
The Lyra, which had been sent a-head on the 25th, to announce our
approach, had anchored in three fathoms, only six miles from the shore.


The height of the barometer varied very little during our voyage
from Hong-kong, but the thermometer and hygrometer underwent
frequent changes. The former, which generally stood at noon in the
bay of Hong-kong at 85°, fell gradually by the 27th to 74°, but rose
after our entrance into the bay of Pe-tchee-lee to 83°. The
hygrometer whilst the S. W. monsoon prevailed, indicated a saturated state
of the atmosphere, but suddenly marked a diminution of moisture
whenever the wind changed to the north. This was strikingly
exemplified on the morning of the 26th, when I observed Leslie's
hygrometer, which for three days had stood at zero, rise to 30°, and on
looking at the direction of the wind, I found that it had changed
from south-west to north. A similar change in the hvgrometer also
took place, even when the northerly wind was accompanied by a
heavy fall of rain. Thus, at noon on the 24th, the wind being S. W. a
large mass of clouds came up with wind from the northward, and
discharged themselves in heavy rain. * During its fall the hygrometer,
which had previously been below zero, rose to 6°. I can perhaps give
no better notion of the excessive moisture of the atmosphere in the
China seas during the S. W. monsoon, than by stating that Leslie's
hygrometer is not graduated to a sufficient extent to mark its degree,
that our clothes were as wet as if they had been exposed to a smart
shower of rain, and that no metallic instruments, however packed,
were secure against its penetrating influence.  
  
  
  * The barometer at the same time rose eight lines.
<!-- Leaf 103, Page: 65 -->

A change of weather also followed the variations of the
barometer, however inconsiderable. Its rise like that of the hygrometer
usually indicated northerly winds; a fall of four lines was followed by
rain; and a fall of a tenth of an inch, by thunder and lightning.


The many accounts I had heard of the dreadful effects of Typhoons,
induced me to collect such particulars respecting them, as I could
obtain from some gentlemen of the East-India Company's service, who
had witnessed them. My enquiries were directed to the state of the
barometer, and of the atmosphere, previous to their approach, and
during their continuance; to the influence which the moon might
exercise over them, during her changes; to the extent of latitude
and longitude through which they have been known to occur; and
to the seasons of the year in which they were most frequent. I
gathered the following information from the answers I received.
The mercury in the barometer falls slowly for several hours before the
commencement of the Typhoon, descends during its continuance below
27 inches, and its re-ascension is a sure indication that the storm is
subsiding. These barometrical movements are not accompanied by
any constant atmospherical changes. The storms occur more
frequently during the changes of the moon than at her full. They
seldom prevail below 10° N. Lat. or beyond the tropic of Cancer.
They are felt as far as 130° E. Lon., and are most violent in the
China seas during the S. W. monsoon, especially in the month of
July. It is also stated that the wind is most violent when it blows in
the direction of the monsoon, but that it also blows strong from all
points of the compass, through which it is continually shifting;
but before the commencement of the gale is generally light.


The state of the thermometer has been little attended to either
before or during its continuance, and that of the hygrometer still
less; it appears, however, that the air feels very cold during its
prevalence, and that it is frequently accompanied by storms of thunder and
lightning, with heavy falls of rain impelled in a horizontal direction.


It is much to be regretted that a full account of the phænomena
of Typhoons has not yet been given by those who have oftenexpeK

rienced their violence, from which some or other of our ships,
especially Indiamen, yearly suffer. It is also to be lamented that the
hygrometer, especially Leslie's, is not more used as a meteorological
instrument. During my voyage I repeatedly experienced the
peculiar delicacy of this instrument in indicating changes in the humidity
of the atmosphere; and as all winds are probably charged with their
peculiar moisture, this instrument would express their slightest
variations. And I have no doubt that by repeated observations a
hygrometrical scale might be formed which would be of great utility
to the mariner.* Mr. Leslie's instrument requires, however, a little
modification before it can be applied with effect in those latitudes in
which the air is saturated with moisture. At present its scale is
graduated to about 120° marking the point of greatest dryness, and
zero the point of greatest moisture :. this last point is placed at the
extremity of the scale near the bulb. In using this instrument in
the China seas during the S. W. monsoon, I found that the fluid of
the instrument remained in that part of the tube which is between
the bulb and zero. Might not this part of the instrument be
lengthened, and zero marked higher up ?


Whenever this instrument indicates a saturated state of the
atmosphere at periods when changes of wind are probable, such change
may be expected to be sudden and violent. For if a large body of very
humid air come in contact with a wind colder than itself, its moisture
will suddenly be precipitated, which producing a comparative
vacuum, either the wind which occasioned it will blow with great
violence, or if the subversion of the equilibrium has been
extensive, every point of the compass will contribute to its restoration.
That something of this kind occurs in the Typhoons of the China
seas, and in the hurricanes of the East and West Indies, appears
very probable from the consideration of the circumstances
attending them. These storms are generally most severe near the land,
and in narrow seas between the tropics, and during the hottest  
  
  
  * See on this subject the Observations of Krusenstern, Peron, and Humboldt.
<!-- Leaf 105, Page: 67 -->
seasons of the year when the air is most rarefied and contains
the greatest quantity of moisture. They are more general also
at those periods when a change of wind is expected, as when the
moon enters her different quarters, and at the change of the
monsoons.


During our voyage up the Yellow Sea, I made many experiments
on the temperature of the water at different depths. The statement
of the greater part of them I lost in the shipwreck of the Alceste,
with many of my other papers. I have exhibited the results of those
which I preserved an account of in the annexed table.


They were made with a hollow brass cylinder capable of containing
about ten ounces of Avater. Valves at the top and bottom permitted
the ingress of the water as the instrument descended, but prevented
its egress when drawn up. A thermometer with Fahrenheit's scale
graduated to degrees was attached to it. Each experiment was
repeated several times, and the instrument alloAved to remain at the
given depths for unequal periods, with the view to ascertain if any
difference of temperature would be the consequence. These periods
varied from five to ten minutes, but in no instance did any alteration
of temperature occur. The water was drawn each time from the
bottom; soundings always having been taken before the experiment
was made.  
  
  
  The four first experiments were made in open sea, the fifth in  
  
  
  k 2
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P105_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 106, Page: 68 -->
the midst of the Mee-a-tau Islands, and the sixth in the Gulf of
Pe-tchee-lee.


From these experiments it appears that the sea diminishes in
temperature in proportion to its depth, and that the difference of the
temperature of the surface, and any given depth within a certain
range, is greater at sea than near the land, and that the difference of
the temperature at the surface and bottom is greatest when that of
the air and surface is least.


But these experiments are not in themselves sufficiently numerous
to warrant positive results to be drawn from them. In reference to
those of others they are more important, and in the Appendix * I have
compared them with many which have been made by different
observers on the temperature of the sea at different depths.


The Lyra not being able to communicate with the Alceste by
signal in consequence of the haziness of the weather, changed her
birth and anchored close to us during the night of the twenty-ninth.
On the following morning, Captain Hall came on board the Alceste,
with information that he had been visited the evening before by two
Mandarins, who stated that the Viceroy of Pe-tchee-lee might be daily
expected at the mouth of the Pei-ho to receive the Embassy.


On the first of August, the same Mandarins waited on His
Excellency with intelligence of this Viceroy's disgrace, and of another
having been appointed to succeed him. They added that a
messenger had been despatched to the latter with the news of our arrival,
and that three officers of high rank appointed to take charge of the
Embassy were already at Ta-koo, and they requested that two of the
gentlemen of the Embassy might be sent to compliment them on
their arrival.


The bearers of this information were of Ioav rank; one wore a
crystal, one an ivory, and two of them gold buttons. They were tall,
robust, and stately men, of very impudent deportment,
endeavouring to pass themselves off for Ta-Gin, (great men :) a title only oiven
to those of their countrymen who are much their superiors in rank.  
  
  
  * See Appendix, F.
<!-- Leaf 107, Page: 69 -->
They were received in some state by His Excellency, who, dressed
in his robes, and attended by Sir George Staunton and Mr. Ellis,
waited for them in his cabin, to which they were conducted by
Mr. Morrison through a passage formed by the other gentlemen of
the Ambassador's suite. Having remained a few minutes in
conference with the commissioners, and having partook of cherry* brandy,
they left the ship, accompanied by Mr. Morrison and Captain
Cooke.


These gentlemen returned to the ship the next morning, having
seen the Imperial Legate and two other officers of high rank, who
were to possess the chief conduct of the Embassay. Quang was the
name of the Legate. Chang and Yin the names of his coadjutors.
The two latter, when Mr. Morrison and Captain Cooke left the shore,
were intending a visit to the Ambassador as soon as the wind, which
was then high, should moderate. The weather, however, for two
days disappointed our curiosity to see them. But the morning of
the fourth of August proving fine, we began at an early hour to look
for their approach, and by ten o'clock in the forenoon observed some
large junks with the insignia of high mandarins standing towards the
ship. They contained Chang and Yin. Two officers of inferior
rank were despatched a-head in a small vessel to announce their
coming, and were the bearers of their cards of compliment. Chang
and Yin arrived in less than an hour after them, and were saluted by
seven guns. Captain Maxwell, Captain Hall, the other commanders
of the squadron, and the officers of the Alceste in their full dress
uniforms, received them on the quarter deck; the marines presenting
arms, and the band playing, as they passed below to the state cabin,
to which they were conducted by Sir George Staunton and Mr. Ellis,
and were received at the door by His Excellency in his robes.


These Mandarins were in appearance much above the middle age.
Chang, the elder, wore the opaque blue button; Yin, the opaque red


* The Embassy found, in every part of China, cherry brandy the most seducing
cordial that they could offer to a Chinese palate.
<!-- Leaf 108, Page: 70 -->
button. Chang was a civil.and Yin a military Mandarin. They had
intelligent countenances and easy engaging manners. But Chang was
graver than Yin, who had already ingratiated himself by his smiles.
They gave me no very exalted notions of Chinese magnificence;
being both very plainly dressed, and attended by a train of very
shabby looking fellows. Yin was accompanied by several soldiers,
who did not add to the dignity of his cortege. Indeed the
appearance of the whole party was strikingly contrasted with the very
tasteful and imposing splendour which surrounded them on board the
Alceste. Her clear and ample decks, her well arranged rigging,
her formidable artillery, her men prompt and orderly, and her officers
in full uniform, formed a picture of propriety and order, of
magnificence and power.


When Chang and Yin entered the Ambassador's presence, their
attendants who attempted to follow them were detained in an
antiroom. They expressed the greatest curiosity to obtain a sight of His
Excellency, often attempting to open the door of his cabin, and
looking much displeased at being prevented. The persons of these
men threw off a most disagreeable odour, arising in some measure
from their use of garlic and assafœtida, but more from their want of
cleanliness. It was some time before I could bear this repulsive
atmosphere with sufficient composure to examine the various parts of
their dress, which had much in novelty at least to attract my attention.
Each man wore by his side a variety of accoutrements, which on a
first glance seemed to be intended for warlike purposes, but on a close
examination dwindled into very peaceful appendages. A worked
silk sheath, in shape like the blade of a dagger, enclosed a harmless
fan. A small leather bag, studded Avith brass, and resembling a
cartouche box, supplied flint and steel for lighting their pipes.
These hung sometimes from their girdles by the side of their
chopsticks, but were frequently in their mouths, pouring forth volumes of
smoke, and giving rise to a flow of saliva which was discharged
without any attention to place.  
  
  
  Both mandarins and attendants wore girdles fastened with clasps
<!-- Leaf 109, Page: 71 -->
formed of different kinds of stone. Of these a coarse green agate,
lapis lazuli, and a stone called Yu, were the most general. Of
the agate I could learn nothing; the lapis lazuli was said to be
common on the island of Hai-nan; the Yu I shall have occasion to
mention hereafter.


The audience having terminated, Chang and Yin left the ship
under the same honours with Avhich they had been received. As
soon as they were gone, a junk came alongside with a present of
bullocks, sheep, pigs, bags of rice, chests of tea, sugar, candles,
and numerous other articles, intended as a supply to the squadron.
But they were not proportionate, especially in bullocks, to the number
of ships. The Chinese explained the deficiency, by stating that ten
oxen had been drowned in attempting to embark them during rough
weather; but they showed no disposition to replace them. With
the provision was brought a large quantity of fuel, consisting of
charcoal and of coal. The former, as far as I could judge from some
partially charred branches not deprived of their bark, was made
chiefly from the oak. The latter contained little bitumen resembling
plumbago rather than coal, and had been brought according to report
from the neighbourhood of Pekin.


The junks which conveyed these supplies were the most clumsy
looking vessels imaginable, but were skilfully managed by the Chinese
sailors. Although their tall masts, each of one entire tree
tapering upwards, frequently surpassed our main mast in height, and
were consequently liable to injure our yards, no accident occurred.
They were provided with excellent cordage made from the fibre of
a plant which grows on the banks of the Pei-ho. Their anchors
were of wood and of iron; the former had only one fluke, the latter
several, and were formed like the grapnels of our boats. * They


* De Guignes describes a similar anchor used by his boatmen on the Grand Canal to
fasten their vessels to the shore. " Dans le cas ou le bateau s'eloigne trop du rivage un
matelot porte alors une ancre a ter re, et Ton vire dessus pour s'en rapprocher: ces
ancres, ou plutot ces grappins ont quatre branches, dont trois sont pointues, et la
quatrieme a un anneau auquel est attachee une chaine de fer qui sert a deraper l'ancre."
Voy. a Pek.
<!-- Leaf 110, Page: 72 -->
differed, however, from them in having a rope fastened to a ring in
one of the flukes by which they could be drawn up Avith great ease.


The men who navigate and probably live in these junks, subsist
chiefly on millet rendered gelatinous by immersion in hot water.
With this they eat a savoury preparation of vegetables cut into small
stripes, and preserved in a kind of soy. At their meals each takes a
basin of millet to himself, but the savoury dish is common to many.
In eating they bring the basin close to the lips, and shovel its contents
by means of their chop-sticks into their mouths till they are fully
crammed; then wedging in a morsel of the piquant vegetable,
masticate the whole together. Having finished their repast, they wash
their mouth with the water in which the millet had been steeped.


The visit of Chang and Yin led to the arrival, on the following
day, of junks for the reception of the presents intended for the
Emperor of China, and of the baggage of the Embassy. The
greatest activity being immediately used in trans-shipping them, it
was reported on the evening of the next day, that the whole of the
presents, and a considerable portion of our stores were safely on board
the Chinese vessels. Mr. Davis and Mr. Cooke visited the shore on
the morning of the 6th of August, to ascertain whether the boats
intended for our conveyance through the country were in readiness,
and returned in the evening with the information that every
thinoAvas prepared for our reception. Junks came off at an early hour
the next morning for the residue of our equipage, but were obliged
by rough weather to make for the shore after receiving a part of it
only. The whole of the 8th proved so stormy as to prevent all
communication with the land. But the next morning beino* fine and
calm, it Avas announced by nine o'clock that all our bao-gao-e had been
embarked, and that junks were in readiness to convey us to the
shore. These having received the servants, band, and guard, Avaited
for His Excellency at a short distance from the ship.


At 12 o'clock at noon of the 12th of August, Lord Amherst and
the gentlemen of his suite left the Alceste in his barge. The yards
of the squadron were manned on the occasion, and successive salutes
<!-- Leaf 111, Page: 73 -->
and cheers bade us farewell from every ship. On reaching the junk
intended for our conveyance to the mouth of the Pei-ho, it was found
very inadequate to the accommodation of the whole party, unless
they stood exposed on its deck to a burning sun. A few, therefore,
took refuge under the awning of the Ambassador's barge, which was
towed alongside.


Having in this manner arrived within a short distance of the
mouth of the Pei-ho, Capt. Cooke was despatched a-head in a
small boat to announce our approach to the Legate. The
Ambassador and his train at the same time changed their situation
from the junks to the boats of the squadron which had accompanied
us; and Avere noAv arranged, under the direction of Capt. Maxwell,
into a picturesque order, in which they proceeded up the river.


The entrance into China by the mouth of the Pei-ho is entirely
destitute of interest. The shores are flat, barren, and marshy:
a few reeds alone giving them an appearance of verdure. Some
mud forts situated on the banks, saluted the Embassy repeatedly
Avith three guns. A band of gaudy troops also met us at the
mouth of the river, and having been passed, moved off to
reappear higher up.


About an hour after leaving the junks, we arrived at Ta-koo, the
first collection of huts that deserves the name of a village on the
banks of the Pei-ho. It was here that the boats prepared for our
reception Avere arranged along the right bank of the river; each
vessel carrying at the mast-head a flag, on Avhich Avas inscribed, in
large Chinese characters, Koong-Tsou, Tribute Bearers ! The
Ambassador's yacht communicated with the shore by a bridge of bamboo
and painted matting. The Legate paid his respects to His Excellency
soon after our arrival, and expressed great anxiety that we should
commence our voyage as soon as possible; but as no part of our personal
baogage had been landed, our departure Avas necessarily delayed till
the next morning. He however immediately set out by land to
prepare for our reception at Tien-sing.  
  
  
  We found the banks of the river covered on our arrival with a  
  
  
  L
<!-- Leaf 112, Page: 74 -->
crowd of people assembled to see the Embassy; and forming a
most motley group. In front were mandarins and soldiers, tawdrily
dressed and variously armed; behind, the mob of all classes and
complexions, some in white robes, others quite naked, some in
immense hats, others with parasols, many bare-headed, and all with
long tails. This diversified mass was suddenly thrown into
confusion by a party of soldiers, who, flourishing whips on all sides,
opened a passage for a number of servants, carrying trays laden
with all kinds of provision in profuse abundance. These formed a
present from the Legate to the Ambassador and his train, and were
placed in order in the fronts of the boats of the three commissioners.
It would be impossible to particularise the different parts of this
ostentatious supply. It comprised all sorts of dressed meat, of
sheep roasted in halves and quarters, pigs and fowls in abundance,
innumerable Chinese made dishes, amongst others, steAved sharks' fins,
stags' sinews, birds' nests, and sea-slugs *, pyramids of cakes and
sweetmeats, a large quantity of pickle, and several jars of wine. A
part of these formed our dinner; and as it was the first time of partaking
of Chinese fare, curiosity induced us to taste the made dishes, but
their flavour did not tempt us to do more. The joints of mutton,
pigs, and fowls, were so besmeared with a kind of varnish, that they
exhibited a perfect metallic polish, and seemed so much more
adapted to please the eye than gratify the palate, that we did not
attempt to injure the brilliancy of their surface.


At the close of day we went in search of our boats, and on finding
them, discovered that no part of our personal baggage had been landed,


* These animals, the bitch de mer of the Portuguese, are in tlie greatest estimation
among the Chinese, who purchase them of the Malays, by whom they are collected
in large quantities from the coast of New Holland. They frequent especially the Gulf of
Carpentaria, where they find these animals in abundance. Mr. Brown observes, Annals
of Botany, Vol. I. p. 395., " They collect two kinds of this animal: the one black, called
by the Chinese batoo, of double the value of the other, which is white, and called by
them roro. A hundred pikol are a load for a prao: the price of the better kind is
forty dollars the pikol, of the inferior, twenty." Mr. B. supposes the animal to be a
species of Doris.
<!-- Leaf 113, Page: 75 -->
and we in vain endeavoured to persuade the Chinese to take our cots
from the junks : bare boards formed our resting places for the night.
The novelty of our situation would alone have prevented our obtaining
any sleep, had not myriads of musquitoes kept us perpetually on the
watch. These tormenting insects Avere more virulent on the banks of
the Pei-ho near the sea, than I had elsewhere found them; their sting
indeed was so intolerable, that it Avas impossible to remain quiet in
any place where they abounded, and no place was free from them.
In \rain 1 endeavoured to escape them: wherever I went, they either
followed or received me; and whatever change of situation I made,
seemed to be a change for the worse.


Early the next morning we took possession of our respective boats,
but found them very defective in their accommodation for the number
of persons whom they were intended to convey. As however we
expected to obtain others in a few days at Tien-sing, and Avere anxious at
starting not to disoblige the Chinese, we made ourselves as comfortable
in them as they would permit, and prepared, though not without a
murmur, for our voyage. We had little cause to look forward with
much pleasurable anticipation to the liberty which we were likely to
enjoy during our passage through China. Whilst we remained at
Ta-koo, a piece of ground, not a hundred yards square, was divided
off for our perambulations, and kept by soldiers, who would on no
account suffer us to pass beyond it. It was therefore with no very
pleasing expectation that we heard the gong give the signal for
departure at ten o'clock in the morning of the tenth of August.


And now my reader is perhaps as anxious to learn, as I was to see,
all that is worth observation between Ta-koo and Tien-sing; but let
me prepare him for disappointment. No country in the world can
afford, I imagine, fewer objects of interest to any species of traveller,
than the banks of the Pei-ho betAveen those places. The land is
marshy and sterile, the inhabitants are poor and squalid, their
habitations mean, dirty, and dilapidated, and the native productions
of the soil are few and unattractive. The scenery had only novelty
and strangeness to recommend it; but had it possessed the attractions  
  
  
  l 2
<!-- Leaf 114, Page: 76 -->
of Arcadia, they would have been polluted by miserable objects
of wretched and naked men, tracking our boats and toiling often
through a deep mire under a burning sun. These poor felloAvs were
attended by overseers, avIio kept them to their work, and prevented
their desertion, but did not, as far as I could observe, exert their
authority with cruelty. Scarcely had our eyes become in some
degree familiarised with their appearance, when they were offended
by the sight of a dead body frightfully swollen, lying on its back,
and floating down the river. Our boatmen passed it without regard.
I must confess, that in turning from the contemplation of such objects,
I recovered with some difficulty that state of mind which Avas
necessary to an unprejudiced examination of the country through which I

was passing.


The banks of the river during our first day's journey were not much
above its level, and seemed to be formed partly by its depositions,
and partly by soil scraped from its bottom, and frequently contained
long beds of shells, which gave them a stratified appearance. The
country beyond them was low, and could seldom be distinguished
from the boats, but when seen exhibited a dreary Avaste, unbroken
by marks of cultivation. Patches of millet, interspersed Avith a species
of bean, occasionally surrounded mud-huts, on the immediate margin
of the river; but their produce could scarcely be considered equal to
the support, even of those people who assembled to see the Embassy
pass. Of these, much the greater number were men miserably clad,
having little else than a thin covering to their loins, and many were
without even this essential to decency. The 1"ew Avomen Avho
mingled with them appeared to be quite insensible to the nudity of
their neighbours; who were so far from considering it offensive that
they frequently applied the only article of clothing, which they
possessed, to their shoulders.


The dwellings of these people were built of mud, had no windows,
but were exposed to the Aveather by a hundred apertures. When they
were in sufficient numbers to form a village, the house of a mandarin
of low rank was generally seen in their neighbourhood. This was
<!-- Leaf 115, Page: 77 -->
usually of a square form, and built of sun-dried brick of a blue colour,
and covered with a shining roof. Around it was a wall, in front of
which stood a high upright pole bearing a flag, inscribed with large
Chinese characters. Over the enclosure I often observed a row of
female heads, which looked as if separated from their bodies, and
planted upon it: they always disappeared, however, when attentively
gazed on.


Amongst the objects which attracted our attention during the day,
the large stacks of salt described by Sir George Staunton and
Mr. Barrow were most conspicuous. These were not however
composed of bags, but of loose salt, which in most instances was
covered with bamboo matting, under a coating of clay. In others,
it was partially or wholly exposed. In the last case, men were
turning it over with shovels, and exposing it to the sun. It was
stated by some of our Chinese attendants, that it was formed in pits,
near the spot on which we saw it.


During our second day's journey, we were often amused by
observing a man or a boy floating down the stream astride on a
bundle of rushes, and directing his course by a single paddle. That
the Chinese should be dexterous in supporting and guiding
themselves in Avater, was little surprising to me Avhen I contemplated the
many children who inhabited the banks of the river, and were
constantly sporting in its stream.


As we adA'anced, the country gradually, though slowly, improved.
The patches of millet became of greater extent; and we saw a
greater number of people perfectly clothed. This alteration of
character was still more apparent when we approached Avithin a few
miles of Tien-sing. Large fields of corn and pulse were iioav frequently
contiguous, the dwellings more substantial, and the inhabitants more
healthy and robust than any we had before observed. The number
of people indeed who lined the banks of the river, and the
numerous boats which blockaded our passage, for the last two or three
miles before we reached this city, \vas incalculably great. But it
must not be supposed that they formed its own population only,
<!-- Leaf 116, Page: 78 -->
since their amount was unquestionably swelled by the inhabitants
of the country for miles around. And even of the multitude whom
we saw, an inaccurate judgment was liable to be formed. It was not
a fixed body of people. Those Chinese who had taken their stations
most remote from the city were the first to obtain a view of the
Embassy, but not satisfied with a single glance, moved with us,
increasing successively the numbers before whom we passed. But as
they were obliged to go behind their countrymen, who would not
relinquish their posts on the margin of the bank, their change of
situation was not readily observable.


The appearance of the people, who were of all classes, was
rather that of inhabitants of different climates than of the same
district. The dark copper colour of those who were naked contrasted
so strongly with the paleness of those who were clothed, that it was
difficult to conceive such distinct hues could be the consequence of
greater or less exposure to the same degree of solar and atmospheric
influence: * but all conjecture on this subject was set at rest by
repeated illustrations of their effects. Several individuals, who were
naked only from their waist upwards, stripped themselves entirely for
the purpose of going into the water, to obtain a nearer view of the
Embassy. When thus exposed, they appeared, in the distance, to
have on a light-coloured pair of pantaloons. But difference of
colour Avas not the only variety of character observable in them.
The eyes of those whose complexion was dark, had less of the
depressed curve in their internal angles, so remarkable in the Chinese
in general, than of those who were of a lighter tint. Indeed in some


* De Guignes makes the following observations on the complexion of the Chinese:
Le teint des Chinois est d'un brun-clair; mais cette couleur varie suivant la qualite des
individus et leur profession. Les coulis, les matelots, les ouvriers, et les laboureurs, plus
exposes par etat a l'ardeur du soleil, sont plus bruns, et meme d'un brun-fonce; tandis que
l'homme en place a le teint plus clair, plus blanc, et quelquefois fleuri. Voy. a Peking,
T<i)me ii. p. 159.
<!-- Leaf 117, Page: 79 -->
instances, as I especially observed in my boatmen, this peculiarity
entirely disappeared. Can these modifications of physical character
depend on varied circumstances of individual habits in the same
climate ?


The land along the banks of the Pei-ho, from Ta-koo to Tien-sing,
bears the strongest marks of recent formation; consisting of clay and
sand, in nearly equal proportions, and being free from the smallest
pebble. The beds of shells alternating with strata of earth, of unequal
thickness, mark its periodical but unequal accumulation by the soil
which is brought down by the river at different seasons. The debris
of the Tartar Mountains afford no doubt the materials of its
composition. Whilst the larger fragments of rocks are retained near
their base, to exhibit perhaps in other times the phenomena of
breccial formations, their comminuted parts are rolled on and deposited
near the mouth of the river, and may at some distant period constitute
rocks of uniform stratification and structure.


The Embassy arrived at Tien-sing, at 4 o'clock in the afternoon of the
12th of August, the third day after leaving the mouth of the Pei-ho.
Soon after our arrival, it was announced that Lord Amherst would
have a conference with the Legate and Soo-ta-jin, a Mandarin of high
rank, on the following day, and partake at its close of an imperial
feast, to which the gentlemen of his suite were also invited. We
therefore set out the next morning at ten o'clock, in procession, for
the hall of audience: the commissioners and suite travelling in
sedans, preceded by the servants, guard, and band on foot.


We traversed several narrow streets lined on both sides with shops
much ornamented; having large and high boards painted of a red
colour, and inscribed with Chinese characters in black and gold,
standing in their front, and forming a gay, and rather pleasing vista. Their
various articles for sale were indicated by a number of
curiouslyshaped emblems hanging in rows before them. Great crowds had
planted themselves in every direction to see us pass, amongst whom
the utmost silence and order prevailed; and although they exhibited
an anxious curiosity to obtain a peep at the inmates of the sedans,
<!-- Leaf 118, Page: 80 -->
not a single instance of troublesome importunity occurred. Very few
women were observed amongst them. Those of whom we caught a
passing glimpse, were peeping from behind the men, and withdrew
their heads the instant they perceived themselves noticed. A great
many well-dressed and interesting-looking children were held up to
see the procession pass : many of them had so little of the Chinese
character in their faces, that they would scarcely have attracted
attention in an English crowd. The men Avere generally Avell made, and
frequently tall; and I did not observe in them that uniformity of
countenance which I had been led to look for in the Chinese. In different
parts of the city, we passed through arch\vays of considerable Avidth,
serving as entrances to principal streets. In these hung swords,
shields, bows and arrows, and other arms.


Having been carried about for nearly an hour, Ave arrived at our place
of destination, and were immediately shown into a spacious apartment,
formed of bamboo and painted matting, and erected for the occasion.
It is difficult to describe the glittering and taAvdry magnificence
which iioav suddenly opened upon us. An immense number of
painted lamps, pictures, and other ornaments, in all the colours of
the rainbow, hung about us on every side; Avhilst a crowd of
Mandarins, in their dresses of ceremony, rendered the animated part of
the scene no less striking.


Lord Amherst, Sir George Staunton, Mr. Ellis, and Mr. Morrison,
having been shown into an inner apartment, to confer with the Legate
and some other Mandarins, the gentlemen of the suite were left to
contemplate at their leisure the objects around them. The room was
of a broad oblong, approaching to an oval. At one extremity, a
projecting canopy decorated with scarlet silk overhung a lono* range
of tables covered with scarlet cloth. On these were placed rolls of
silk and cotton of the most dazzling colours, intended as presents for
the Embassy. The floor of this division of the room was raised above
its general level. Immediately in front of it, two rows of small low
tables were placed on the right and left hand for the feast, having by
their side carpets and silk cushions for the accommodation of the
<!-- Leaf 119, Page: 81 -->
guests. Beyond them was a screen of curious workmanship,
representing a vine in full fruit. The whole was worked in relief. The
fruit was imitated in glass (the Chinese said gems) of different colours,
with which the artist had expressed, with great effect, its different
degrees of ripeness, transparency, and bloom. The leaves andtendrils, formed of the same material, were equally well executed; and
the trunk carved from the wood of the screen in every respect
resembled what it was intended to represent. A table covered with
yellow cloth, and supporting a vessel of smoking incense, stood
before it: the whole was symbolical of the presence of His Chinese
Majesty. All around this sacred emblem, carpets were laid in regular
approach for the accommodation of its faithful votaries. Beyond
these, an open space was terminated by a stage, gay with all the
colours that Chinese fancy could suggest. Pots of flowers and dwarf
trees were distributed over the room, and Avere often mingled with
pieces of limestone. Along its sides tables and benches were arranged
for the use of the Mandarins in waiting, who regaled themselves with  
  
  
  M

<!-- Leaf 120, Page: 82 -->
tea, ice, and fruit. The Mandarins were rather gorgeously dressed,
although their external garment was plain; being a loose crape robe,
with no other ornament than a stork or a tiger, denoting their civil
or military order, worked on the back or breast. Beneath this, and
disclosed by its movements, appeared a silk petticoat, beautifully
interwoven with gold and silk, in the forms of dragons and flowers.
Their boots were of satin, and served them for pockets. Their caps
were small and conical, covered with long red hair, and surmounted
with a globe, whose colour indicated their rank. Fans, pipes, and
chop-sticks, hung by their sides; and English Avatches, in embossed
cases, were suspended from many of their girdles. These were
highly prized by the wearers, who anxiously enquired our opinion
of their value. * Their fans were not costly in their materials or
construction, and in no respect resembled those elegant specimens
of Chinese workmanship which are imported into Europe from
Canton; being formed of paper and Japanned wood, with a few
devices faintly sketched upon them. A supply of these wasdistri
* In every part of China, through which the Embassy passed, watches were considered
as objects of the greatest curiosity. The attendants of the Embassy were perpetually
requested to dispose of their's. I was not, however, able to ascertain, whether they valued
them as markers of time, or simply as curious baubles. That they use them, however,
as horaries, is probable, as the division of the Chinese day nearly resembles our own. The
Chinese reckon twelve hours to each day. The first hour begins at eleven at night, and
finishes at one in the morning. Each hour is divided into two Poen-chy, (half hour);
each Poen-chy into four quarters, named Chy-ke. The hours are generally named
according to their succession, as Tse-chy, first hour; Tcheou-chy, second hour. They also
receive the names of animals; as,

There can be no doubt, as far as the experience of the members of Lord Amherst's
Embassy goes, that watches are the most acceptable presents, on a small scale, that can be
offered to the Chinese of all ranks.
<!-- Leaf 121, Page: 83 -->
buted to the gentlemen of the Embassy, and were rendered very
acceptable by the excessive heat of the day.


Nearly two hours had elapsed before His Excellency re-appeared
in the banquetting-room. It was impossible to doubt the cause of
his delay : he was arguing the question of prostration. We looked
at the screen with unpleasant anticipations, as the Chinese pointed to
the carpets, and most significantly acquainted us, that on them we
must knock our heads. At length the Ambassador came and informed
us of the nature of the ceremony that he intended to go through. It
Avas of the same kind, he observed, as that which he sometimes
performed before the empty throne of his OAvn sovereign : he should bow
as often as the Mandarins prostrated themselves. He then advanced
towards the screen, and was placed, Avith Sir George Staunton, Mr.
Ellis, and Mr. Morrison, immediately before it, having six
Mandarins of high rank on his right-hand, and the gentlemen of his suite
behind him. At a signal given by an officer, Avho uttered a feAv
Avords * in an exalted and singing tone, the Mandarins fell on their
knees, and, inclining their heads, knocked them three times against
the ground, and then arose. A second and a third time the signal
was repeated, and a second and a third time they knelt and knocked
their heads thrice against the earth. The Commissioners and the
gentlemen of the suite boAved respectfully nine times.


When the ceremony Avas completed, His Excellency, Sir George
Staunton, and Mr. Ellis, Avere conducted to the tables prepared for
them on the right, Avhilst the principal Mandarins seated themselves
at others on the left, assuming to themselves the place of honour, f


* Mr. Bell, in speaking of the ceremony performed by the Russian Ambassador before
the Emperor, at Pekin, states, that " The Master of the Ceremonies stood by and
delivered his orders in the Tartar language, by pronouncing the words morgu and boss: the
first meaning to bow, and the other to stand." " Two words," he adds, " I shall never
forget."


f De Guignes states, that " the place of honour amongst the Chinese is on the right;
amongst the Tartars, on the left;" an observation we had no opportunity of verifying. In
every instance of ceremonial observance which we saw in China, the left was the situation
of honour.

<!-- Leaf 122, Page: 84 -->

A crowd of servants immediately entered, bringing trays containing
part of the feast, which they placed on the tables. Four courses
were served: the first consisting of soup, said to be composed of
mares' milk and blood; the second, of sixteen dishes of fruits and
dried meats; the third, of eight basins of stewed sharks' fins, birds'
nests, harts' sinews, and other viands used by the Chinese for their
supposed aphrodisial virtues; and the fourth, of twelve bowls of
different kinds of meat cut into small pieces, and floating in gravy. In
addition to the usual Chinese table apparatus of chop-sticks and
porcelain spoons, we were supplied with four pronged silver forks, curved
like a scymetar. The wine, made from rice, was contained in small
earthen kettles, from which it was poured into porcelain cups, by
servants bending on one knee, and was drunk warm.


During the feast, a play was performed; and, at its close, feats of
tumbling were exhibited. The dresses of the performers were
verygorgeous, and were said to resemble those Avorn by the Chinese
before the Tartar conquest. Confusion and noise were the only
circumstances of the performance which impressed themselves upon
me, for I could understand no part of the story. The tumbling was
more expressive of strength and agility. After continuing at table
about an hour, we rose, and the performance ceased. The back part
of the theatre was then thrown open, and disclosed a long passage of
painted matting, terminated by a rude drawing of a large dragon.


Having returned to our boats in the same order in which we had
left them, we received presents of silk, cotton, and the remains of the
feast. Each gentleman was presented with four pieces of coloured
silk; and each of the servants, guard and band, with four of coloured
cotton. His Excellency, Sir George Staunton, and Mr. Ellis,
received separate presents.


At day-light the next morning we left our anchorage, and again
proceeded on our route up the Pei-ho. My companions were some
way a-head when I discovered that my boat was still at anchor, and
on going out to enquire the reason, found that my trackers had
absconded and that others had not yet been provided. Whilst waiting
<!-- Leaf 123, Page: 85 -->
for their arrival, my attention was attracted by several Mandarins
sitting along the bank of the river, smoking their pipes. Whethe
they were indulging in a morning habit, or whether they were officers
who had been superintending the departure of the Embassy, I could
not learn. They were of high rank, and received frOm a number of
Chinese who had occasion to pass them numerous and profound
salutations. These were always very ludicrous, and often very servile.
Where the difference of rank was small, the inferior contented
himself with a slight curtsey, and the usual chin-chin, which is performed
by clasping the hands, and moving them quickly two or three times
up and down before the breast; but where it was great, he made a
succession of what might be called running curtseys; moving rapidly
towards his superior, he performed as many genuflexions as possible
in a given time. These were sometimes so low, that I was surprised
how he could keep his legs whilst making them. A great number of
peasants were at this time carrying into the city, or depositing on
stalls in its vicinity, a great variety of vegetables, and large masses
of ice; who, although they passed close to the Mandarins, did not
salute them. In China, a salutation from an inferior, to one very
much his superior, is considered a mark of impudent familiarity, and
subjects the former to the paternal punishment of the bamboo.


The thickness of the ice which I here saw sufficiently testified the
severity of the cold which must prevail in these parts during the
winter. Two large lumps, about the size of an oyster-barrel, fastened
to shallow baskets, and suspended from the end of a bamboo
supported across the shoulders of the bearer, were carrying about in
all directions. No people understand better, or use more, the
refreshing qualities of ice during hot weather, than the Chinese. Every poor
fruiterer whom we met with in the environs of towns or cities in the
north of China, either vended masses of it at the lowest price, or used
it for cooling his articles of sale: Nothing was more common in the
precincts of Tien-sing and Tong-Tchow, than to see Chinese sucking
fragments of it, or carrying it about in their hands. The steward of
the Embassy was supplied with it in profusion, for cooling wine.
<!-- Leaf 124, Page: 86 -->
The Chinese preserve it in the usual way, by burying it deep in the
ground during the summer.


Trackers being at length supplied to my boat, I soon rejoined my
companions. We passed, during the day, many of the junks which
convey corn to Pekin, answering, in number and magnitude, to the
description given of them by the writers of the former Embassy;
and having, from the manner and order of their arrangement, a very
imposing appearance: they were moored in regular succession along
shore, their lofty and highly-ornamented square sterns meeting us as
we ascended the river.


Immediately after quitting Tien-sing, the country exhibited much
of the same characters of wildness and flatness which they possessed
from Ta-koo to that place. The chief difference consisted in an
addition to the kinds of cultivated plants. Besides millet and beans,
the Sida tiliæfolia, one of the hemp plants of the Chinese, the Sesamum
Orientate, from which they extract an esculent oil, and the Ricinus
communis, castor-oil plant, continually occurred in patches, or in fields.


Our progress up the river was slow, in consequence of the repeated
visits paid by the Mandarins to His Excellency, in order to press his
performance of the ceremony of prostration.


On the morning of the 16th of August, at the termination ofa
conference which the Ambassador had held with the Legate, the boats,
instead of advancing, dropped down the stream, and anchored before
a village called Tsai-tsun. Lord Amherst informed the gentlemen
of his suite, at breakfast, that there Avas great probability of the
immediate return of the Mission, in consequence of his refusal to
perform the ceremony. We therefore concluded, that this retrograde
movement Avas preparatory to our going back; but were glad to learn
that intelligence had been received of the departure of our ships from
the Gulf of Pe-tchee-lee, as the Chinese would consequently be obliged
to conduct us through the country to Canton.


During the delay of the boats, I visited the shore, and penetrated
into the country to some distance beyond the banks of the river in
search of plants, but was not well rewarded for my trouble. The
<!-- Leaf 125, Page: 87 -->
Polyganum lapathifolium, and aviculare, two species of Chenopodiwn,
the Tribulus cistoides, Statice limonium, and Hibiscus trionum, were the
only uncultivated plants which I met with. In my walk, I was taught
not to trust to the appearance of cultivation on the banks of a river
as an indication of the general fertility of a country. In the
immediate vicinity of Tsai-tsun, the Holcus Sorghwn, the Kow Leang, or
tall corn of the Chinese, clothed the margin of the river. Its high and
thickly planted stems had prevented our seeing the country beyond
them whilst we remained in the boats, and had led us to suppose that
it Avas generally well cultivated. I now found it to consist of a sterile
marsh, extending to an undefinable distance. The soil collected from
the river, and sometimes deposited by its overflow, frequently
rendered its immediate precincts productive, whilst all beyond was
untouched by the hand of the cultivator. At this early period, I was
enabled to observe, that much as the Chinese may excel in obtaining
abundant products from land naturally fertile, they are much behind
other nations in the art of improving that which is naturally barren.


On my return, I passed through the village, and was presently
surrounded by its male inhabitants. Dirt, squalidness, and extreme
poverty, were as usual their leading characteristics. Their habitations
were miserable beyond any thing which England can exemplify.
Built of mud, and divided into unfurnished rooms, ventilated by
several apertures, they looked more like the dens of beasts than the
habitations of men. The state of these huts, and the want of clothing,
may produce little human suffering during the summer; but as the
winter of this part of China is long and severe, its inhabitants must,
Avithout better provision against cold, endure great misery. In the
midst of so much poverty, I was astonished at meeting with three
women not only decently, but handsomely clothed, whom I
surprised in turning suddenly the corner of a house. They Avere standing
in an angle formed by the projection of two walls, and could not
well escape me; indeed they showed little inclination to do so, but
appeared much pleased with an opportunity of examining one of the
<!-- Leaf 126 -->
gg CHINESE VILLAGERS.

horse-faced men. * These women were of low stature, had faces
longer in proportion than those of the men, but so covered with a
flesh-coloured paste, that I could not distinguish the tint of their
complexions. There was a general air of languor about them, which
was especially marked by the drooping of their upper eyelids, the
interval between which and the lower ones was so narrow, as scarcely
to appear sufficient for the purposes of distinct vision. Their
internal angles were more deflexed and lengthened than in the eyes
of the men. Their hair was black, and neatly rolled up on the crown
of the head, and ornamented with flowers. Their dress consisted ofa
loose blue cotton robe with long sleeves, and a pair of loose trowsers
of the same material, but of a pinkish colour. The robe was fastened
before by several buttons from the chin downwards, and fell below
the calf of the leg. Its sleeves covered the hands. The trowsers were
fastened about the ancle, and almost covered with their folds the
small and tight shoe which peeped from beneath them. I had
contemplated these curious objects for some time, when our mutual
admiration was broken in upon by the appearance of some soldiers, who
caused the fair ones to hobble off as fast as their crippled and stunted
feet could carry them.


No manners could be more simple and obliging than those of the
villagers, when they were satisfied that there was nothing
mischievous in my disposition; for, in their first deportment towards
me, they evinced the same sort of feeling which is sometimes
experienced in approaching an animal whose temper is unknown. This
Avas strikingly displayed by the children, who, observing me much
employed in collecting plants, immediately began to gather them.
They then approached with caution, step by step, holdino* their
offerings at arms' length, and running off the instant I attempted to
take them. When, however, I had once received any part of them,

  VISIT TO A CHINESE COLONEL. gg

all restraint ceased, and I was presently laden with bundles of flowers,
Avhich although of no great variety, I could seldom refuse; as, in
doing so, I occasioned very evident chagrin to my young friends.

On the morning of the 17th, the Ambassador having had another
conference with the Legate, the boats quitted their anchorage, and
again proceeded with their heads' tovvards Pekin. In the evening,
I walked along the banks of the river, accompanied by Mr. Amherst
and Mr. Poole, till we were very disagreeably pressed by a crowd of
Chinese who collected about us. We then stopped before the boat
of a Mandarin, and being invited in, went on board. This
gentleman, a Colonel in the Chinese army, was sitting, Avhen we first
saw him, on the bow of his boat, naked to his waist, reclining on
a chair with a sloping back, and smoking his pipe. He quitted
both on our entrance, and immediately clothed himself. We were
hospitably entertained, and treated with fruits and wine. The wine
Avas heated in a small kettle over a basin of boiling water, and
drunk from small porcelain cups, not much larger than a thimble.


Having remained as long as we wished, I proposed rejoining our
companions; but on rising, we were rudely, the Chinese would say
politely, replaced on our seats, and now found that our boats were
not in sight. The vessel in Avhich we were, had moved from the shore
Avithout our knowledge, and Avas now very far ahead of the barges of
the Embassy. It Avas eight o'clock, and very dark. I began to fear
that His Excellency Avould be alarmed at the absence of his son; but
in A^ain endeavoured to impress the same apprehension on the mind
of the Mandarin : he insisted that we should remain, and ordered
his servants more than once to lead me back to the cabin, which
I had left to ascertain if the lamps of the Ambassador's barge
were visible. It Avas ten o'clock before we again anchored, and
twelve before the boats of the Embassy arrived, which had been
delayed by the grounding of several, in consequence of the
shallowness of the river. As soon as the Mandarin Avas informed of their
near approach, he ordered his servants, dressed in their costume of
ceremony, to conduct us to the Ambassador's yacht; on reaching  
  
  
  N
<!-- Leaf 128, Page: 90 -->
which, I Avas glad to find that no alarm had been excited, as we had
been seen to enter the Chinese boat.


On the following day, we arrived within fifteen miles of
TungChoAV. The face of the country varied much during the last few
miles of our progress, the banks of the river becoming higher, more
sandy, and less fertile. The millet disappeared, and no cultivation
was to be seen but in the distance. In the back ground, on both sides,
small houses, surrounded by trees, were frequently distinguished,
and were more numerous in proportion to our advance. No village
Avas near the place of anchorage for the night, but a great number
of Chinese formed a kind of encampment about us, having a variety
of provisions for sale. These consisted chiefly of small round flat
cakes, hard-boiled eggs, walnuts, areca-nuts, and tobacco. The
venders of these articles carried them about on small wooden stands,
suspended from the ends of bamboo, which they bore across their
shoulders. Our boatmen, who bought nothing that was not
repeatedly weighed, gave us no very high opinion of the honesty of their
countrymen. Different kinds of refreshment were also to be obtained
in a large booth erected within a few yards of our boats. This was
formed of matting, and divided into two unequal partitions : the
larger served as a room of general accommodation, and was fitted up
with tables and benches; the smaller was used as a kitchen. Our
trackers occupied this building, partaking largely of their favourite
Sam-tchoo and hot millet cakes. The tout ensemble had so much the
appearance of a resort of gypsies, that I did not look for much
cleanliness in its culinary arrangements; but on visiting the interior of
the kitchen, found the different utensils for cooking arranged Avith
great neatness and order. The cook, a plump and sleek old man,
naked to the waist, seemed from his complexion to have passed all his
life within the influence ofa furnace. He had supplied himself with
an ample store of charcoal, with Avhich he kept up fires in small stoves
of baked brick placed on a table before him. Over these were set
large iron bowls, in which he baked, and preserved hot, cakes formed
of flour, sugar, and the oil of Sesamum : these materials Avere kept
<!-- Leaf 129, Page: 91 -->
ready mixed by his side. He Avas much pleased by my visit; showed
me all the secrets of his art, and begged me to partake of its produce;
but this Avas too much impregnated with the oil of Sesamum to be
at all agreeable to my palate. This favourite ingredient in Chinese
dishes, is expressed from the baked seed of the plant, and has a
highly empyreumatic flavour.


Leaving this place, I passed, on the way to my boat, the tents of
our Chinese soldiers, arranged along the shore, and forming a scene
of much interest. Each Avas lighted by a blood-red lamp suspended
from three sticks set up in a triangle in front of its opening. Groups
of soldiers were sitting around them, either smoking their pipes or
playing at dominos. 1 placed myself in the midst of one of them,
and at once dre\v their attention towards me. They examined every
part of my dress, and seemed especially struck by the fineness of my
linen, and the apparent richness of my gilt buttons. Not satisfied
with a superficial examination, they pressed me to take off my coat
and other parts of my dress, and did not appear altogether contented
at my non-compliance with their Avishes. They were less fastidious
on their part; not only removing any part of their clothes which
they thought me desirous to examine, but urging me to keep it; and
Avould not be satisfied until I had accepted a Avhite linen badge
inscribed Avith large Chinese characters, which Avas Avorn by each
soldier about his neck. The largeness and length of my hands also
occasioned them some surprise and amusement: theirs, like those of
all the Chinese, when compared Avith the hands of Europeans, are
very small. When placed in mine, (which are not excessively large,)
wrist against wrist, the ends of their fore-fingers scarcely extended
beyond the first joints of mine.


At an early hour on the following morning, we were again in
procress towards Pekin, and reached Tung-Chow, twelve miles from
Pekin, at four o'clock in the afternoon. Crowds of people on the
shore, and in boats, assembled to witness our approach, exhibiting
the same general characters as those whom Ave had seen at Tien-sing :
but a greater number of them bore the marks of extreme poverty.

  CHAPTER IV.

The quarters prepared for the British Embassy at Tung-Chow were
scarcely capacious enough for the accommodation of its principal
members, consisting chiefly of a small suite of apartments, composing
a long building of one story, having a colonnade before it, and situated
at one end of an enclosed yard, which was entered by a gate at its
other extremity. These were occupied by the Ambassador and one
or two of the principal members of the Mission : the others
preferred sleeping in their boats, but assembled at meals in the
Ambassador's house.


Report having informed the unofficial part of the Mission, that at
Tung-Chow the question respecting prostration Avas to be finally
determined, they looked anxiously for events which should speedily
decide their fate. On the afternoon of the 21st, the arrival of
Imperial Commissioners of very high rank was announced by some
Mandarins Avho Avaited on His Excellency. We Avere at dinner when
the coming of these persons was made known, but the Ambassador
immediately prepared to receive them. The guard was turned out,
and the band ordered to play on their entrance. Sir George
Staunton, Mr. Ellis, and Mr. Hayne, waited for them at the gate of the
court-yard, while His Excellency remained a few steps in advance
of the door of his apartment. They did not keep us long in
expectation. Six Mandarins, all of whom wore either the clear or opaque
blue button, and three of them peacocks' feathers, soon entered, with
an air of haughtiness that it is impossible to describe. They pushed
rudely past the gentlemen at the gate, without returning their
salutation; scarcely noticed His Lordship, and hastening into his
apartment, took the seats of honour before he entered. Such a prelude
to a conference predicted the shortness of its continuance. It did
<!-- Leaf 131, Page: 93 -->
not last ten minutes; and at its termination, the Mandarins were
dismissed with every mark of contempt. The band was silenced;
and the guard, Avhich had been drawn out, was ordered to withhold
the intended salute on their return. The despicable presumption of
these men gave a foretaste of the treatment that His British Majesty's
Representative afterwards experienced from their superiors.

The Imperial Commissioners proved to be very exalted personages :
their names Ho* and Muh. Ho was brother-in-law to the Emperor,
had distinguished himself by his personal bravery in a late rebellion
which had shaken the Chinese throne, was now one of the chief
ministers of state, and might be considered in rank equal to a Duke,
by which title he was usually distinguished in the Embassy. Muh
was the President f of the Le-poo, or Tribunal of Rites and
Ceremonies. They differed from each other in age, person, and manners,
but were both Tartars. Ho, in appearance between thirty and forty
years of age, was in stature about the middle height, of a robust form,
and dark ruddy complexion. In his deportment he was strikingly
frank, but impetuous and overbearing. Muh, on the contrary,
venerable in years and in person, was gentle in manner, and chiefly
remarkable for unyielding taciturnity. These men had come to
instruct the Ambassador in the correct mode of performing the Tartar
ceremony, not only in the presence of the Emperor, but before every
piece of yellow rag Avhich they might choose to consider as
emblematical of the presence of His Chinese Majesty. The Duke seemed
disposed to carry his point by a violent and threatening manner; the


* Ho's name at full length, according to Mr. Morrison, was Ho-she-tae; which
translated is " Ho great in his generation." He held several important situations, the
principal of which was the Presidency of the Board of Foreign Affairs.


■f Mr. Morrison has observed, that in China there are only seven persons who hold
the office of Shang-Shoo, or Presidents Three of these were now with the Embassy :
Ho, le-far-yuen shang-shoo, President of the Board for Foreign Affairs; Muh, le-poo
shang-shoo, President of the Board of Rites; and Soo, (who had met the Ambassador
at Tien-sing,) kung-poo shang-shoo, President of the Board of Public Works.
<!-- Leaf 132, Page: 94 -->
President had been too often drilled into the habits of passive
obedience, to support his colleague otherwise than by silent acquiescence.


The morning following the impudent visit of their envoys, His
Excellency, accompanied by the other Commissioners and his suite,
visited them both at a small public building in the middle of the
city of Tung-ChoAAr, at the distance of rather more than a mile from
his residence. The Commissioners Avent in sedan-chairs; the suite
in carts. The sedans were not uncomfortable conveyances; but the
carts fully merited the character given of them by different European
writers, who have experienced the effects of their motion; being in
fact the most execrable machines imaginable. They were made of
very strong materials, firmly fastened together. The Avheels,
frequently Avithout spokes, were low, and fixed to very short axletrees.
The bodies, covered Avith tilts of matting, open only in front, were
just wide enough to admit tAvo persons Avedged close together; had
no raised seats, and were in contact with the axles. Such a
construction, in no Avay lessening the force of the shocks to which they are
perpetually liable from the nature of Chinese roads, although of little
consequence to the Chinese, who through habit readily
accommodate themselves to their motion, was to us a serious evil. The only
method used to render these vehicles at all tolerable, is in moving
the Avheels so far back as to throw the weight between them and the
horse; but of this contrivance we had no opportunity of
experiencing the comfort. Yet, however inconvenient, they Avere Avell
defended from the weather by coverings of mats; and a screen,
extending from the top, defended the mules which drew them.


The road through which we passed, on our Avay to the place of
audience, was cut into deep and unequal ruts, filled with fluid mud,
which threw off, when agitated by the passage of the carts, an
offensive exhalation nearly equalling that of the fish-market of St.
Sebastian. We were obliged to bear it, being unable to cover our nostrils
with our hands, which were employed in supporting us against the
concussions that our machines every instant received. We were indeed
<!-- Leaf 133, Page: 95 -->
so bruised, as to feel no desire for a repetition of the same discipline.
Little did we expect what Avas awaiting us in our Yuen-Ming-Yuen
expedition.


The Duke received the Commissioners and Mr. Morrison in a
small hall, in front of which was a court-yard. As usual, no
accommodation was provided for the other members, Avho were permitted
to take their choice between a drenching in a heavy rain, and
suffocation in a crowded room of ill-savoured and importunate Chinese.
Fortunately for us, the audience soon terminated. The Duke had
insisted on the performance of the ceremony of prostration, and the
Ambassador had peremptorily refused to comply with it. The Duke
had threatened to send him from the empire without seeing the
celestial face of the Emperor, and His Excellency had declared his
readiness to depart. The latter, however, put into the hands of
the former a letter addressed to His Chinese Majesty, containing
his reasons for declining to perform the ceremony. This letter
was readily received by the Duke, who appeared glad of a plea for
moderating the high tone he had assumed. On this letter now
seemed to depend our only chance of visiting Pekin. During the
conference, the voice of the Duke was heard very high and decisive
in all parts of the court-yard.


We returned from the hall of audience in the same manner as we
went to it, again undergoing the cart exercise, but were unable to
observe much order in starting. The Chinese muleteers hurried us
into the vehicles; and as soon as they saw their respective passengers
fairly seated, carried them off without waiting for their companions.
On this, and on every other occasion in which the British Embassy
appeared in public, the Chinese seemed to imagine, that the only
persons necessary to accommodate or oblige, were the heads of the
Mission. When they were induced to attend to the convenience of
its other members, they were generally influenced either by fear or
interest.


In returning to the Ambassador's house, Ave were obliged to
content ourselves with a mere passing glance at the city and its inhabitants.
<!-- Leaf 134, Page: 96 -->
Shut up in our tomb-like vehicles, we could see little that was not
straight before us, but that little in a good measure satisfied our
curiosity. The interior of the city, of all the places which I ever
beheld, was the most filthy. The rain, Avhich fell in torrents on the
morning of our visit, had perhaps rendered it more so than usual;
but heaps of dirt, which every where strewed its streets, marked
their usual uncleanliness. In one lane the horses were knee-deep in
mud, and the bottoms of the Commissioners' chairs touched its
surface. The smells which arose from these sources were sufficiently
noisome in themselves, but received an increase of offensiveness from
the peculiar odours which were thrown off by numerous cook-shops
that lined our road, aided perhaps by the dead animals, too closely
resembling cats and dogs, which hung in their front.


Tung-ChoAv is similar in the general arrangement of its streets to
Tien-sing; but in the cleanliness of the houses, and the appearance
of its inhabitants, is much inferior to it. To Captain Cooke, who Avas
on horseback, and had better opportunities of observation than
those who travelled in carts, I am indebted for the folloAving remarks
on its walls and gates. " To reach the outer wall Ave passed over a
bridge thrown across a ditch of sufficient width and depth, if kept
clear, to form a considerable obstacle to besiegers. The wall appeared
to be from sixty to seventy feet high, and judging from the length of
its arched gateway, fifty feet thick. When beyond this, we passed
another at right angles to it, in a second Avail of about thirty feet in
thickness. The gates were of wood, seven or eight inches thick.
There were numberless embrasures in the walls and gateways for
arrows or musquetry : I saw no great guns."


For two or three days after our visit, communications took place
between His Excellency and the Duke, the result of which was only
known to the diplomatic part of the Embassy. But the movements
of the Chinese soldiers, and the report of a person in the Embassy
being obnoxious to the Chinese government, kept us in a state of
uneasy feeling. The guards round our quarters were doubled, and a
<!-- Leaf 135, Page: 97 -->
caution published that the Chinese should avoid conversation with
the strangers. These measures were adopted by the Chinese in the
hope of influencing His Lordship's decision, respecting the
performance of the ceremony of prostration, in their favour. It is
almost needless to remark, that they were ineffectual.


On the morning of the 27th, His Excellency sent a note to the
Duke, definitively declaring his intention not to perform the
ceremony; and requesting that the necessary arrangements might be made
for his departure. We therefore looked for our immediate return;
and it was with equal surprise and satisfaction that we witnessed a
visit from the Duke to the Ambassador in the afternoon of the same
day, to acquaint him with the Emperor's intention to wave the
ceremony of prostration, and to receive him on his own terms,
at the palace of Yuen-Ming-Yuen. The Duke was now all smiles
and graces, and seemed as urgent for our instant departure for the
Imperial Presence, as he had before been to keep us from it. Orders
were immediately given for landing the presents and baggage, and
the next day was named for our journey.


So much expedition was used by the Chinese, in providing the
necessary means of transport, that by three o'clock in the afternoon of
the 27th, every article had been put into waggons, or on machines to
be carried by hand. An elegant barouche was at the same time
unpacked for the conveyance of the Ambassador, his son, Sir George
Staunton, and Mr. Ellis. To draw this, four mules were provided,
but so small, that they were almost lost in the splendid harness
brought from England for their equipment; the collars especially being
so large, as to require considerable ingenuity to fit them to their
necks. Four sedans were directed to follow, to be in readiness in
case of accident, a circumstance not unlikely to occur, as coach, mules,
and roads, were unadapted to each other. The whole equipage,
however, exhibited a good appearance, and excited great astonishment
in a crowd of Chinese who assembled to see it.


Carts and saddle-horses were provided for the conveyance of the
gentlemen of the suite, and waggons for the servants, band and guard.

<!-- Leaf 136, Page: 98 -->
The carts, drawn each by one mule, resembled those which I have
already described. The horses were miserable looking animals, both
in themselves and in their caparisons. That on which I rode was
about thirteen hands and a half high, of a bay colour, having all his
bony points extremely prominent. Accustomed to follow en train,
and of an obstinate temper, he would seldom pass any of his kind;
and always chose his own pace, which was something between a trot
and an amble. His equipment perfectly harmonised with his personal
properties. Two pieces of board forming the saddle, met at so
acute an angle, that his bare spine would have afforded a more
pleasant support. Behind and before it had two high projections,
on the former of which I occasionally sat, to relieve myself from the
effects of its central portion. A piece of scarlet cloth Avas indeed
thrown over; but as this was continually slipping, it rather increased
than remedied the inconvenience arising from the bare boards. A
piece of old cord formed the girt, and permitted the saddle to turn,
when I endeavoured to mount. The stirrups were suspended by
strings, so short, that they scarcely hung beneath the animal's body,
occasioning some danger of collision between my knees and nose.
The bridle was of no better materials, and had a bit which the animal
totally disregarded. A piece of cord attached to the reins served as
a whip. Such an outfit would not have excited dissatisfaction, had it
been similar to that of equestrians of respectability in the country;
but I did not witness an instance of the poorest Chinese being more
miserably mounted. Remonstrance was in vain; the mandarins
insisted that no better means of conveyance were to be obtained, and
many of the gentlemen preferred any other mode of travelling to
that of the carts.


One of the servants and one of the guard being too ill to travel
without the means of more convenient transport, application was made
to the Chinese for litters. Two were brought, but of a description
that it was impossible to use. They were nothing more than two
straw or wicker baskets, three feet and a half long and two broad,
having the half of their bottoms out, and the remainder so rotten,
<!-- Leaf 137, Page: 99 -->
that there was every probability of its giving way. In these machines
the Chinese proposed to place the invalids, unsheltered from the
weather. On their being pointed out to His Excellency, he
declared that he would not quit Tung-Chow till others of a better
description were provided. Several of our Chinese attendants
immediately pretended to seek them; but in their peculiar spirit
returned with a cart, appointed to convey one of the gentlemen, but
of which they had taken possession during his absence. Lord
Amherst now directed that two of the sedans intended to follow
his carriage, should be given up to the sick, and thus secured
to them more easy vehicles than any which the Chinese seemed
disposed to afford.


Every thing being at length ready, our journey commenced at
four o'clock in the afternoon. The gentlemen on horseback went in
advance of the carriage, the sedan chairs followed immediately
behind it, then the carts, next the servants, band and guard in
waggons, whilst the rear was closed by our baggage. Every point of
the procession was surrounded by mandarins and soldiers in chairs
and carts, on horseback and on foot: the whole moved at a foot-pace.
We soon reached the gates of Tung-Chow, through which we
expected to pass; but the ways proving too narrow for His Lordship's
carriage, we took a road under its walls. These are of an oblong
square, as stated by Du Haide, and are built of an ill-burnt brick of a
blue colour. No masonry could be less expressive of strength, or
in a state of greater dilapidation. Leaving the city, we soon
reached a handsome bridge of one arch, built of a granular
limestone, and ornamented with figures of lions. Having left this, we
came to the paved road which extends from Tung-Chow to Pekin.
The pavement consisted of large blocks of granite, so irregularly laid,
that large chasms from long wear had intervened between them
sufficiently deep for the overturn of carriages. These continually
occurred through its whole extent, and occasioned the greatest
annoyance to those who travelled in carts. That part of the country
through which we passed whilst day-light continued, was on each side  
  
  
  o 2
<!-- Leaf 138, Page: 100 -->
of the road well cultivated with millet; but exhibited no scenery
with any claim to description.


We travelled so slow, that night came on before we had
{empty}.advanced five miles. My horse I very soon abandoned; and having
with no unintelligible marks of contempt yielded him up to a
soldier, endeavoured to prosecute my journey on foot, and was
instantly surrounded by a crowd of Chinese soldiers and porters, who
accompanied us, and peasants who had assembled from the
neighbourhood. Their usual importunity was growing exceedingly
troublesome, when the coming up of the black drummer of the band
suddenly relieved me. This man, of a fine figure, six feet in height,
of a jet black complexion, was an object of irresistible curiosity with
the Chinese. Wherever he went, crowds followed, and left every
other person of the embassy to gaze upon him. To feel his hands,
and to compare their colour with that oftheir own; to endeavour by
signs to ascertain from what part of the world he came, was their
frequent and eager employment. We always thought ourselves fortunate
in our excursions when he had preceded us, and carried off the
mob. I continued my walk till after dark, when haA'ing suffered two
or three severe falls from the holes in the road, I took refuge in the
cart of a friend.


About nine o'clock the procession halted at a small village distant
five miles from Pekin. The Ambassador was conducted to a building
more resembling a shed than a house, and ushered into a large
apartment intended for the accommodation of all the persons
of the Embassy, and some of their horses. At its further
extremity, a long table was spread for the Ambassador and gentlemen of
his suite; in the centre, benches and tables were placed for the
servants, guard and band; and at a short distance beyond these, horses
received their fodder. Our repast consisted of foAvls served up whole,
but without any instruments to carve them. We were consequently
obliged, much to the amusement of the bye-standers, to separate the
limbs with our fingers. Water, and spirits in taste and strength like
alcohol, were given us to drink. The room was filled by Chinese, who
<!-- Leaf 139, Page: 101 -->
were present for any purpose, rather than that of attending on the
Embassy. In short, a more disagreeable entertainment cannot be
imagined. But all fared alike; for in this instance, the Chinese made
no distinction in the accommodation of the Ambassador and the
lowest of his train. After the delay of about an hour, His
Excellency readily yielded to the solicitation of the attendant Mandarins
to hasten our departure for Pekin. These gentlemen, of whom
Quang and Soo were the principal, urged Lord Amherst to
depart, with much anxiety of manner, alleging as an excuse for their
importunity, that the Governor of Pekin was waiting his arrival at
the gates of the city.


When preparing to leave, I found that the sick had suffered much
from the journey, and that their number had been increased by
one of the band who had fallen ill on the route. For these, who
were all suffering from acute disease, and liable to severe pain from
slight motion, application was again made to the Chinese for
comfortable litters, but without effect. The only relief that could
be afforded to them was in large doses of opium, larger indeed
than, under ordinary circumstances, it would have been prudent to
administer, but which fortunately diminished their sensibility so
much as to enable them to complete the remainder of the journey
without severe suffering.


The Ambassador having again taken possession of his carriage,
the different persons of his suite went in search of their respective
carts, but had the greatest difficulty in finding them. They had
been removed from the neighbourhood of the shed in which we had
supped, into a sort of stable yard, in its neighbourhood. Not being
acquainted with this circumstance, the gentlemen in vain wandered
about for some time in the dark, without receiving any assistance
in their search from the numerous Chinese who surrounded them,
and who only grinned on witnessing their dilemma. Accident at
length relieved them from their embarrassment; but few I believe
re-possessed themselves of the same carts that had brought them
thus far on their journey.
<!-- Leaf 140, Page: 102 -->

I was more fortunate than many of my companions. The manner
in which I had relinquished my horse on the road induced the
Chinese, who ahvays watched minutely the actions of the persons
of the Embassy, to replace him at our halting-place by another of a
very different character. He Avas respectable both in condition and
equipment, and soon enabled me to overtake the Ambassador, leaving
the carts vvith the other gentlemen far behind. *


Having given my horse to a servant, I mounted the box of the
carriage, which was noAv escorted by men carrying large flambeaux, a
precaution necessary to prevent its overturn by the inequalities of
the road. The carts were lighted by small paper lanterns of
a red colour, which in a long line produced a singular effect.
About tAvelve o'clock we reached the suburbs of the city of Pekin,
and found even at this late hour Chinese curiosity fully awake.
Thousands of people crowded the road, holding up their small oval
lanterns to gain a view of the procession. The light of these Avas
sufficient to discover the faces of the crowd and the style of the
buildings by which we were passing. It was a strange scene. The
eye, after wandering over numberless naked and illuminated heads,
rested on gilded Piazzas stretching in front of the houses, and
reflecting the light of the torches.


We were in constant apprehension of driving over the people;
but were saved from this misfortune by a band of Chinese soldiers,
who flourishing whips on all sides, cleared the way with great
dexterity. After proceeding some time, we became anxious to reach
the city gates; but were soon mortified, by observing that the
carriage was quitting their direction, and that our conductors' tale
of the Governor of Pekin waiting our arrival, was only an instance
of Chinese falsehood. The carriage being now directed to the


* There can be little doubt from our subsequent experience, that the confusion and
difficulties which embarrassed the suite, after the departure of His Lordship, were planned
by the Chinese'to separate them from each other.
<!-- Leaf 141 -->
  
  YUEN-MING-YUEN.

j

outside of the walls, all the skill of the coachman was requires
to prevent its overturn. The danger arose from the narrowness
of the ways, being only suited to the short axles of the Chinese
carts. We first passed through a lane having a high bank on
one side and a deep ditch on the other, and when clear of this,
entered upon a succession of bridges, overhanging deep ravines,
and formed of planks without parapets, and with scarcely sufficient
width to admit the wheels of the carriage. Beyond these, we gained
a road passing between the walls and a ditch, which seemingly
encircled the city. This road being rather good, we were
congratulating ourselves upon a termination of our difficulties, when the
carriage became fixed in a deep mire. All the efforts of the mules could
not for some time move it, although assisted by several Chinese,
who put their shoulders to the wheels. Whilst we were thus
circumstanced, Mandarins continually went by, without paying any attention
to our unpleasant situation. The Commissioners having alighted,
the carriage was at length drawn out, and proceeded without further
obstacle, till it reached at the dawn of day the celebrated gardens of
Yuen-Ming-Yuen.


The morning was fine, and opened to us a scene of novelty and
beauty. After travelling, since leaving Ta-koo, through an
uninterrupted flat of two hundred miles, remarkable neither for its
productions or cultivation, we beheld unusual charms in the hills,
trees, and flowers which surrounded us. Fields of Nelumbo rearing
high its glossy leaves and gorgeous flowers, edged by trees with
the foliage of the Cassia, spread at our feet, whilst the Tartar
mountains approximated by the haze of the morning rose in the
distance. All the descriptions which I had ever read of the
paradisiacal delight of Chinese Gardens occurred to my imagination;
but in imagination only was I allowed to enjoy them. Acts of
fraud, tyranny, and violence speedily effaced the first rising of
pleasurable emotion.


Arrived within a short distance of the imperial palace, the
Ambassador's carriage was stopped by some Mandarins in their
<!-- Leaf 142, Page: 104 -->
dresses of ceremony, who from a crowd of others advanced to
meet it. Several of these, amongst whom were Soo-ta-jin and
our conductor Quang, immediately requested His Excellency to
enter the imperial place. His Lordship at first refused,
pleading fatigue and illness, and begging to be led to the quarters
prepared for him; but after repeated solicitations and assurances
that he would only be detained to partake of refreshment, he
alighted, and, accompanied by his son, Sir G. Staunton, Mr. Ellis,
and a few of the gentlemen of his suite who chanced to be about his
person, passed through a multitude of Mandarins to the palace.
Repeated attempts appeared noAv to be made to separate His Lordship
from his attendants, by carrying him rapidly forward; obliging them to
use considerable exertion to keep up with him, by pressing through a
host of opposing Chinese. At length the whole party reached the
palace, and were pushed into a room, which, if a fair specimen of
other parts, might induce the supposition that His Chinese Majesty
was king of the beggars. On entering, it Avas impossible not to
be reminded of Van Braam's exclamation under similar
circumstances, Nous voila done a notre arrivee dans la celebre residence
imperiale logis dans une espece d'ecurie. Nous serious nous attendus
d une pareille aventure. This room was perhaps twelve feet in
length and seven in breadth, and was surrounded on all sides by
windows, or rather openings furnished with shutters in the same manner
as the port-holes of a ship. Its roof was a tattered paper sky-light.
The shutters were thrown open, to gratify the curiosity of the lower
class of Chinese, whilst crowds of Mandarins and Princes of the
blood satisfied their's by filling the room almost to suffocation.
As soon as His Excellency entered, he threw himself upon a
bench, much exhausted by fatigue, watching, and agitation of mind.
All followed his example, and pretended to sleep in the hope of
avoiding the ceaseless importunity of the Chinese. But they would
in no respect suffer our repose. In a feAv minutes after our arrival,
came Soo-ta-jin, stating to the Ambassador the desire of the Emperor
to see him and the other Commissioners. Lord Amherst replied, that
<!-- Leaf 143, Page: 105 -->
fatigue, illness, and the want of the necessary attire, rendered his
compliance with the Emperor's desire almost impossible; and requested
that His Majesty would allow him that day to recover himself,
begging at the same time to be conducted to the dwelling appointed for
him. His Lordship's excuses were not received. The Emperor's
wish was again and again urged, as not to be rejected; but His
Excellency adhered to his former remonstrance. Soo-ta-jin was
strongly supported in his solicitations by the legate, Quang.
Finding, however, that their entreaties were unavailing, they retired;
but Avere immediately succeeded by the Duke, who entered the
room with a determined air, and going up to the Ambassador,
repeated the Emperor's desire to see the Commissioners; adding,
that they Avould only be required to perform the English ceremony.
On receiving the same answer that had been given to Soo and
Quang, he caught His Lordship rudely by the arm, beckoning at
the same time to some surrounding Mandarins to assist him. They
obeyed the signal, and stepped forward; but before they reached
the Ambassador, we started up, and advanced towards him, Avhen in
the act of shaking off his unmannerly assailant, This sudden
movement stopped the Duke, and alarmed his attendants; the former
quitted his hold, and the latter fell back, with countenances full of
astonishment. His Lordship, freed from the grasp of the Duke,
protested, with great firmness and dignity of manner, against the
insult which he had received, and claimed to be treated as the
representative of a great and independent Sovereign; declaring,
that force alone should carry him into the Imperial presence. The
Duke at once altered his tone, endeavouring to make it appear,
that what we had considered as an attempt to force the Ambassador
from the room, was only the Chinese mode of assisting a person
unable to walk; adding, that a sick man had no will of his own;
and in the most persuasive manner, entreated His Lordship to
Avait on the Emperor, who, he said, merely Avished to see him on
his arrival, and would not detain him. Persuasion, if it could have  
  
  
  p
<!-- Leaf 144, Page: 106 -->
availed at first, was now too late. Defeated in his purpose, the
Duke left the room in high displeasure.


It was now that His Excellency appealed to us, as witnesses of
the violence which he had suffered; and looking to the probability
of its recurrence, cautioned those who were armed, against using
their weapons in resisting it. Our reflections at this period were
not of the most pleasing nature. We could not but be sensible,
that we were in the hands of a despotic and capricious government,
whose ministers had been repulsed in an attempt to carry a point of
the deepest interest to themselves, and who were obviously free
from the restraint of courteous feeling. Indignation, however, was
our predominant emotion; and was in no small degree increased by
the annoyance that we experienced from the number of eunuchs,
mandarins, and princes who infested the apartment.
Notwithstanding the strongest appeals made by Mr. Morrison to their sense
of propriety and civility, they continually pressed upon us;
examining our persons with the most unceremonious closeness. They
even wished the Ambassador, who was reclined on the bench, to
rise, that they might the better view his person. It was plain that
they looked upon us as a strange species of animal, whom it was
curious to observe, but as beings without the pale of civilised
treatment. They also seemed to suspect that we might not be
perfectly harmless. Had they again attempted to carry their first
intention into effect, they Avould probably have discovered that
Englishmen had not been trained in the habits of non-resistance
to tyrannical insult.


Our speculations were soon interrupted by the arrival of a
messenger from the Duke; who acquainted His Lordship, that his visit
to the Emperor would be dispensed with, and invited him to the
Duke's apartments, that he might be free from the pressure of
the crowd. His Lordship, looking at this invitation as a mere feint
to draw him into the Imperial presence, at once refused it;
observing, that if he were well enough to visit the Duke, he could have
no reason for refusing to see the Emperor. On receiving this reply,
<!-- Leaf 145, Page: 107 -->
Ho became again impatient, and again waited on His Excellency.
In this visit he was all civility, and used every motive that he could
imagine to induce the Ambassador to meet his wishes. His
importunity being too suspicious to be complied with, he again left the
room Avithout attaining his object; but only to harass His Excellency
with message after message, to Avhich he always received the answer,
that " the Ambassador wished to be led to the house prepared for
him." After some time the messages became less frequent, and
then altogether ceased. Mandarins and soldiers, who had been drawn
up in the front of the palace, were observed to disperse; and
intelligence Avas soon after brought to the Ambassador, that he was at
© ©
liberty to go to his own apartments, and that he would be attended
by the Emperor's physician.


His Lordship immediately quitted the palace, and endeavoured
to reach the carriage, Avhich had remained in the place where we
had left it. At first, great difficulty was experienced in getting
through the Chinese who surrounded us. Several soldiers, armed
©
with whips, attempted to open a passage; but as they only struck
the ground, their efforts were unavailing. We had, however, more
effectual aid at hand. The Duke, who had followed us closely,
seeing our impediment, seized a whip, and striking furiously all
the Chinese who did not fly before him, speedily cleared our path;
the nobles of all ranks, in their dresses of ceremony, sprawling over
each other in their efforts to escape him. We now soon reached
the quarters prepared for the Embassy, in the village of Hai-tcen,
and found our companions, who had been purposely separated from
us, perplexed at our absence, and overcome with fatigue.


The Ambassador was immediately visited by the promised
physician. This gentleman, who appeared to be something beyond the
middle age, was dressed as a Mandarin. He felt His Lordship's
pulse in both wrists; and having observed that his stomach was
probably disordered from the use of a Chinese diet, recommended
repose and an emetic, and retired. The report of this person to the
Emperor, materially influenced, as it afterwards appeared, our
subsequent treatment.

The house intended for the accommodation of the Commissioners
was sufficiently comfortable, both in itself and its situation, and had
been the residence of Chou-ta-jin, one of the worthy conductors of
Lord Macartney's Embassy, who was now on the frontiers of Russia.
It consisted of apartments communicating by door-ways covered
with rolling screens formed of rattan. Its furniture, exclusive of
tables and chairs highly varnished, consisted of large couches covered
with embroidered scarlet silk. It stood in an enclosed space of some
extent, laid out in a tasteful manner, and ornamented with showy and
interesting plants. Suites of rooms for the accommodation of the
other members of the Embassy were comprised in detached
buildings in its neighbourhood. These had not much to recommend

© °
them, being little better than counterparts of our reception-room in
the palace. We passed to them through archways and circular
openings * in walls surrounding small gardens. In one of these, a large
building, open in front, and supported by pillars covered with yellow
silk, was prepared for the reception of the presents.


Having partaken of a splendid breakfast, consisting of the choicest
Chinese fare, we retired in search of the repose which should enable
us to enjoy the inviting scenes in our neighbourhood. We were
too much fatigued by the journey of the preceding night, to wait the
unlading of our cots, but throwing ourselves on benches or chairs, Avere
soon in a deep sleep. But scarcely had we begun our dreams of all the
beauties of Yuen-Ming-Yuen, when we were roused by the noise of
preparation. It was the preparation for our instant return to
TungChow. The Emperor, incensed at the Ambassador's refusal to visit
him, had commanded our immediate departure. Chang brought
the order, and Avas soon followed by a Mandarin, who, in a loud


* It is very common in China to see the apartments of dwelling-houses and temples,
and the out-door enclosures, communicating with each other by round door-ways. De
Guignes observes, " La porte du bonheur est celle de forme ronde, celle ci a la vertu,

logis de leur malignes influences."

voice and imperative gesture, called for the principal interpreter.
Mr. Morrison appeared. " I am a messenger," said this pompous
gentleman, " from the Keu-mun-te-tuh, governor of the nine gates
of Pekin, the greatest military officer of the empire; commander
of a million of men. He orders the Ambassador instantly to quit
the limits of his command." * Such a mandate Avas not to be
entirely disobeyed; we therefore prepared to depart, but not with
all the expedition that the Chinese wished, They proposed sending
our baggage after us, but could not induce His Excellency to set out
till he was satisfied that every article Avhich had been removed from
the carts was replaced.


Although now in circumstances the most disgraceful in Chinese
estimation, being under the displeasure of the Emperor, we
experienced some sympathy in our misfortunes. Yin, the military Mandarin
who had accompanied us from the Gulf of Pe-tchee-lee, walked from
person to person, condoling Avith each as well as he could, and
attributing our difficulties to the will of heaven. Many of the inferior
Chinese attendants had also more of compassion than of triumph in
their countenances, and endeavoured by signs to induce us to eat,
before we undertook our troublesome journey. And let me not
here pass over the humane conduct of a poor Chinese tOAvards myself.
He was a young man avIio belonged to Mr. Morrison's boat, and
acting as that gentleman's servant, had been often employed for me
in collecting plants, for Avhich he received a small recompense.
Seeing me at this time in search of a cart, he led me to the best he could


* This gentleman did not confine himself to the strict purport of his message, but took
occasion to give his opinion of the conduct of the Ambassador. " The Ambassador," he
said, " has behaved rudely. Your King is respectful and obedient, but your Ambassador
is not: he has used disrespectful language. The Emperor will write to the King, and
complain of him." On being told that the Ambassador had only begged His Chinese
Majesty graciously to defer the audience, he exclaimed, " The ceremonies of the Celestial
Empire are unalterable." " This is no time to talk of ceremonies," observed Mr.
Morrison. " Nor am I sent for any other purpose than to order your departure," rejoined
the otber, and went away.
<!-- Leaf 148, Page: 110 -->
find, recommended me strongly to the care of its driver, and during
the journey brought me refreshments, when no exertion of my own
could have procured them.


Before leaving Yuen-Ming-Yuen, a request was once more made
in behalf of the sick, whom it appeared quite hazardous to subject to
the inconveniences of another night-journey, that they might remain
behind under the care of their medical attendant till the next day.
This application being made to our conductor Chang, he readily
ansAvered, that " as they would only have to travel tAventy lees, less
than seven miles, that night, they had better go with the other
persons of the Embassy." This answer is a good illustration of
the falsifying disposition of the Chinese. They seldom directly
refuse a request which they do not intend to grant, but evade it by a
lie which is not immediately palpable. Chang knew that the
Embassy were to be hurried as fast as possible to Tung-Chow; but by
speaking the truth, he could not haAre freed himself so easily from
our importunity. Another attempt to obtain litters having no better
success than that made at Tung-ChoAv, the invalids were put in
possession of the carriage of His Lordship, who determined to return
to Tung-Chow in a chair.  
  
  
  'S


As soon as the Ambassador entered his sedan, the different
vehicles containing the persons of his train were hurried off at a rapid
pace. The pomp of imperial favour no longer attended us. The
confusion and haste of a forced journey took place of the slow
movement and orderly arrangement of a procession. The croAvd of
Mandarins and soldiers that had hitherto attended us, disappeared, and
were not replaced by a single responsible person.


We reached the city of Pekin at the close of day, stepped from
our carts to steal a piece of its walls, had just time to observe that
they Avere built of a sun-dried brick of a blue colour, resting on
a foundation of blocks of granite, and were hurried round them
to its suburbs. It was dark when we entered them. Anumberless mob again surrounded us, thrusting their lanterns, hanging
from the ends of short staves, into the carts, to obtain a view of our
<!-- Leaf 149, Page: 111 -->
faces. As we were not in a humour to indulge their curiosity, many
of their lanterns coming in contact with our feet, were sacrificed to
our irritability. Beyond the suburbs, we again got upon the paved
road, and travelling along it at a fast trot, felt the sensation of
continual dislocation and replacement in every joint of our bodies. About
twelve o'clock many of the Embassy halted in a heavy rain at the
house in Avhich we had received our strange entertainment the night
before. Neither shelter nor refreshment being now provided, we took
refuge in our carts; and during their delay of an hour, obtained some
sleep, and then proceeded on our journey. At four in the morning
we reached Tung-Chow, and gladly entered the boats; which, in our
present circumstances, had the attraction of homes. The buildings
that had been occupied by the Commissioners were closed against us.


The boatmen were much surprised at our sudden return, but
received us joyfully and kindly. These men, who, in their ordinary
habits of life, often suffer from hunger, and at all times feed on a
meagre diet, had fared sumptuously on the redundant supplies of the
Embassy. They had also experienced the liberality of individuals, and
were for these reasons glad to see their benefactors so soon in a
situation to renew their services. They did not, however, fail to speculate
amongst themselves on the cause of our sudden appearance, and to
express their surprise at our escaping the wholesome correction of
the bamboo, for our insolence in opposing the will of their mighty
Emperor. Lord Amherst, Sir George Staunton, and the other
gentlemen who travelled in chairs, did not arrive till some hours after the
carts. The carriage with the sick was obliged to stop all night on the
road, near Pekin, in consequence of not being supplied with either
guides or torch-bearers. Many casualties had occurred on the journey.
Several of the baggage-waggons had been upset, and much of the
baggage was injured. But this was a slight grievance. One of His
Lordship's servants was nearly killed by the overturning of his cart, through
the carelessness of his driver; receiving in the fall a severe
concussion of the brain, the effect of which still incapacitates him for his
usual avocations.
<!-- Leaf 150, Page: 112 -->

When we were someAvhat recovered from our fatigues, and looked
back on the occurrences of the last two days, we seemed rather to
have awakened from a dream, than to have experienced any
circumstances of real existence. It was impossible to link them together
in any probable chain of cause and effect. We could only conjecture
that we had been hurried to and from Yuen-Ming-Yuen, and
subjected to all kinds of indignity and inconvenience, to suit the will of
a capricious despot. It would have been in vain to calculate on the
next events. The same Avill might load us with fresh insults, or again
call us to the imperial presence.


Before night, our suspense was in some degree relieved by reports,
from authentic sources, that the Emperor had been deceived by his
ministers respecting the real cause of the Ambassador's refusal to
visit him, and lamented his hasty dismissal. Early the next morning
these rumours were confirmed by the arrival of Soo and Quang,
with presents from the Emperor to the Prince Regent, consisting
of a sceptre cut from a siliceous stone, of a greenish white colour,
and called by the Chinese Yu; a necklace of agate, and other
beads; and several embossed silk purses. In return for these, they
selected from the British presents portraits of the King and Queen,
a painting of Doncaster horse-races, several engravings, and some
maps of China; manifesting, as an Imperial Edict afterwards
expressed it, " the idea of giving much and receiving little ! !"


It was about this time verbally communicated to Mr. Morrison,
that the Emperor had been kept in ignorance of the circumstance
of our having travelled all night, or being Avithout the costume
necessary to appear in before him; and that the only plea that had been
alleged for the Commissioners' refusal to enter the presence, was
the Ambassador's illness; which there was reason to suppose the
Chinese physician had declared to be feigned. It Avas also stated,
that all the Chinese officers who had been connected with the
Embassy, were degraded. It was, in fact, afterwards ascertained, that
Soo had been condemned to lose his situation of President to the
Board of Works, together with his peacock's feather, and to be
<!-- Leaf 151, Page: 113 -->
reduced to a button of the third order; Ho to relinquish his title of
Kung-Yay or Duke, to be mulcted in a heavy penalty, and to lose
his privilege of wearing a yellow riding-jacket: Muh to lose his
Presidency; and Quang his situation of Salt Commissioner. After the
interchange of presents, no doubt remained that our early departure
Avas decided on.


Having now given an account of the most interesting public
transactions of the Embassy, as far as they fell under my own
observation, up to the period of its leaving Tung-Chow, I shall conclude
this chapter with a few remarks on the environs of this place, and
their inhabitants.


It has been remarked, by the author of an Essay entitled, " Idee
general e de la Chine," that it might be concluded, from the
relations of travellers who have only visited the sea-ports of China, that
in this country, as in Lacedæmon, theft was permitted, if successfully
practised. If giving false Aveight, charging centuple prices, and
substituting bad articles for good, form a species of theft, it is not
confined to the sea-coast, but is practised all over the empire of
China, and is not only tolerated but applauded, especially when
foreigners are its victims.* It was constantly practised upon us in the
most barefaced manner at Tung-Chow, and indeed every where else in


* I might readily show, that in this statement I only accord with the generality of
writers who have had occasion to consider the general character of the Chinese. They
are too numerous to be all quoted; but the opinions of Le Comte and Du Haide, two
writers best able to appreciate them, I cannot avoid giving: — " Leur qualite essentielle
c'est de tromper quand ils peuvent. Us falsifient presque tout ce qu'ils vendent. II est
sur qu'un etranger sera toujours trompe, s'il achete par lui-meme, quelque precaution
qu'il prenne." — Nouveaux Memoires sur la Chine, par Louis Le Comte, torn. i. p. 362.


\"Quoique generalement parlant, ils ne soient pas aussi fourbes et aussi trompeurs que
le P. le Comte les depeint, il est neamoins vrai que la bonne foi n'est pas leur vertu
favorite, sur tout lorsqu'ils ont a traiter avec les etrangers; ils ne manquent gueres de les
tromper s'ils le peuvent, et ils s'en font un merite; il y en a meme qui etant surpris en
saute sont assez impudens pour s'excuser sur leur peu d'habilite.


\"Cette adresse a tromper se remarque principalement parmi les gens du peuple, qui
ont recours a mille ruses pour falsifier tout ce qu'ils vendent; il y en a qui ont le secret
d'ouvrir l'estomac d'un chapon, et d'en tirer toute la chair, de remplir ensuite le vuide,
et de fermer l'ouverture si adroitement, qu'on ne s'en appercoit que dans le temps quel'on
veut le manger."— From p. 77. torn. ii. par le P. du Haide.

China. A kind of balance is used by the Chinese in weighing that
enables them readily to deceive the unsuspicious; and gave us many
opportunities of witnessing their frauds. It is formed of a long rod
or beam, of wood or ivory, with a scale at one end and a moveable
weight at the other. The rod is intended to be suspended in
equilibrium by a piece of string passing through it. The Chinese, by
having two strings at some distance from each other, can alter at
pleasure the length of the lever, proportionably increasing or
diminishing the weight. Of this construction they never failed to take
advantage, at our expense, whenever an opportunity presented itself.
I ought, however, to observe, that the soldiers, who accompanied
us in our excursions, would have obliged them to act thus, if they
had not been prompted by their own disposition. These harpies
followed us in all our rambles, and, entering the shops, desired
the tradesmen to overcharge us; and when a bargain was
completed, received the whole of the extra profit.


Nothing could better illustrate the contemptible and
pusillanimous policy of the Chinese towards the Embassy, than the jealous
manner in which they watched our visits to some stalls on which
arms were exposed for sale. They had so great an objection to
our purchasing any weapon of the country, as to seize a SAvord,
bought by a gentleman, at the moment when he Avas carrying it
openly into the Ambassador's quarters.

eighteen-penny and three-shilling pieces were particularly in
request, and seemed to be as highly prized as the Spanish dollar.
Indeed, so far did the inhabitants carry their anxiety to possess a coin
with a perfect device, as to offer me handful after handful of their
small copper money, called Tchen *, for a few silver Java coin with

the figure of a horse on one side. The same coin was valued by
their money-changers at seven Tchen. This estimation of the
value of small silver pieces could only be the consequence of their
rarity, as all silver passes with the Chinese by Aveight. The
smallest portion of a dollar goes for its relative worth, as readily
as the whole coin. Silver, for a medium of circulation in China,
is melted into conical masses, having the form of the crucible in
which they have been formed. For large payments, the entire
masses are used; for smaller, bits of these are cut off, and weighed
on the spot. For this purpose, a Chinese usually carries about
with him a pair of scissars and a small balance, of the nature just
described, and very sensible, the rod of which is usually of ivory. *
Gold, in China, is purely an article of merchandise.


Whilst the Embassy remained at Tung-Chow, we were not
permitted to enter the city, but to visit its suburbs at pleasure. These
afforded, hoAvever, little that was worth the labour of toiling for,
under a hot sun, through a crowd of Chinese, being composed of long
dirty streets, lined with paltry shops and houses of public
entertainment. Much the greater number of the former were filled with
the winter dresses of the Chinese. The skins of every species of
animal within their reach, from the ermine to the mouse, had
been converted into apparel. The most common were deer, dog,
goat, and squirrel skins. Rat and mouse skins sewn together, and
formed into long cloaks, were also frequent, and had in the eyes
of a stranger a very singular effect. Indeed, there was nothing that
gave so peculiar a character to the streets, as the fur cloaks with

long sleeves hanging up before the doors, and looking like so many
decapitated Chinese. Many of these dresses had been handsome;
the ermine cloaks having sometimes collars of sable, and linings
of silk richly figured. They were all, however, second-hand,
and possessed the true Chinese smell. It was impossible to obtain
their common prices, as the salesmen, through the influence of our
attendant soldiers, always asked of us more than their real value.
I gave fourteen Spanish dollars for a deer-skin cloak.


These furs were formerly chiefly brought from Siberia, in caravans.
These, according to Mr. Bell *, were allowed by the Emperor's favour
to remain in free quarters during their stay at Pekin, and have
the liberty to dispose of their goods, and buy others, without the
exaction of any impost. The value of one of them Avas
reckoned to amount to four or five hundred thousand roubles, and
yielded a return of at least double that sum. The Chinese also
obtained a large supply of sables from the Tonguese, who inhabit the
southern branch of the river Amoor. f They still derive them from
these sources, but also obtain a large supply from North America. J


Next in number to the fur-shops, were those of the druggists.
These were remarkable for their superior cleanliness; and, in the
arrangement of their various drawers and jars, greatly resembled

of the Mongalls near the river Selinga, and running from thence eastward, it makes the
frontier of these parts between Eastern Siberia, and the Oriental Mongalls; and after a
course of more than 300 German leagues, it discharges itself into the sea of Japan, in

those of Europe. The medicines vended in them appeared to be
all from the vegetable kingdom.


The public houses were large open sheds, fitted up with tables
and benches, and afforded the means of gambling and drinking to
the lower class of the Chinese; and were generally filled with
players at dominos or cards, who seemed to enter with intense
earnestness into their game. The cards were small pieces of
pasteboard, about two inches in length and half an inch in width, having
black and red characters painted upon them. The beverage most
largely partaken of in these houses was tea and wine; but sam-tchoo
was also drunk. This liquor, which, from the quantity we met
with in China, must be in general use, more resembles alcohol in
flavour and strength than any other spirit with which I am
acquainted. It sometimes, indeed, has a smoky flavour, resembling
that of Avhiskey. It is distilled from rice or millet, and flavoured,
the Chinese said, by the seeds of the bamboo. The wine, according
to De Guignes*, is nothing more than water in which rice or millet
has been fermented. All the guests in these houses were smoking
from pipes of various length, from two to five feet, formed of the
young and slender twigs of bamboo, fitted with bowls of white
copper, about the size of a thimble.


Having seen so many people on the banks of the Pei-ho
exhibiting all the exterior marks of sordid poverty, we felt no surprise
that many of them should be driven to mendicity for the means of
existence. At Tung-Chow we met with the first of the many proofs
which occurred to us in China, that it extensively prevails in that
country. Beggars frequented the suburbs, some of whom were
miserable objects of deformity, and all exhibited the marks of
extreme penury. One man, who occasionally crossed my path,
was withered in his thighs and legs, which he writhed about for the
purpose of extorting charity. Those who were not prevented by

disability of body, followed us through the streets and into shops,
not quitting us till they were relieved or driven back by the soldiers.
On some occasions they prostrated themselves before us, exhibiting
vile examples of human degradation, and knocking their heads to the
earth, exemplified the nature of the kotow.


My obsen^ation on the extent of mendicity in China is, I am
aware, at variance with the remark of the learned author of "
Travels in China," that he " did not observe a single beggar from
one extremity of China to the other, except in the streets of Canton."
Our opportunities of visiting the cities of China being more frequent
than those possessed by that gentleman, may perhaps explain the
contrariety of experience; or the opposite characters of Kien-Lung
and Kea-king, the emperors who filled the Chinese throne at the
respective periods of Lord Macartney's and Lord Amherst's embassies,
may have occasioned a very different management of the internal
affairs of their empire. Kien-Lung, of an active mind and enlarged
policy, making frequent journeys through his empire, examining in
his own person the state of his people, or employed in his palace in
scrutinizing the reports and actions of his ministers, Avould be infinitely
more competent to prevent the extremes of poverty among his
subjects, than Kea-king, the victim of jealous fear, struggling against
rebellion*, and unacquainted with the condition of his people, except


* Kea-king, the present Emperor of China, a man of a timid and vacillating temper,
sufficiently proved by his conduct to the British Embassy, was almost shaken from his throne
by a conspiracy which broke out in his capital, and penetrated to his palace, in the year
1813. It was subdued in a great measure by the personal bravery of his brother-in-law
Ho-she-ta, who slew several of the principal ringleaders with his own hand.
Seventeen persons were ordered for execution as rebels, at Pekin, in the following year, some
to be cut into minute pieces, others beheaded. Thirty-five were by the tribunal
sentenced to transportation; but His Majesty changed their sentence to strangling, after a
certain period of imprisonment.


The year following the rebellion, an imperial edict was published in Pekin, a
translation of which, made at Macao, affords so excellent a specimen of the style of these royal
compositions, for they are supposed to be written by the Emperor's own hand, that
I have given it, with others of a similar nature, in the Appendix.
<!-- Leaf 157, Page: 119 -->
through the representation of his favourites, whose falsehood or truth
he is from all accounts too weak to estimate.


But whatever be the true explanation, there can, I apprehend, be
little doubt that mendicity has been common in China, at various
periods, from the earliest ages of the Christian era. In the reign of the
Emperor Tay-tsoung, of the dynasty Chong, occupying a part of the
fourth century, it was formally reported to the Emperor by one of his
counsellors, that " men were found in the country and in cities who
could only obtain the means of existence by begging."* From
Nieuhoff we learn, that at the time of his visit to China, beggars, " bold and
troublesome," " ill-featured and mis-shapen," " covered with sores,
mangled, and deformed," frequented the toAvns and cities of the
empire, "f Mr. Bell's work;): affords similar evidence; and De Guignes,
who attended the Dutch Embassy, declares, that in his journey he met
with them in towns and cities; and Huttner, according to the same
author, affirms that the city of Pekin is filled with them. § Such are
the benefits of the boasted patriarchal government of China.


The reader will readily imagine, that my visits to streets displaying
no other objects than those which I have just described, were
not very frequent. I should have been glad to direct them to
the neighbouring country, but it was forbidden ground; whenever I
was tempted to penetrate only a short distance beyond the space
covered Avith houses, I was hurried back by the soldiers Avho attended  
  
  
  me. It was not till after we left Tung-Chow that our conductors

thought it proper to bring us into good humour, by giving greater
latitude to our researches. I therefore restricted myself to forming
acquaintances with the occupiers of houses which stretched along that
bank of the river by which our boats Avere anchored. These people
being all timber-sellers, with whom I could not deal, had noself* Memoires concernant les Chinois, torn. v. p. 163.

interested motive, the main spring of Chinese actions, to abuse my
confidence, and proved, in fact, a most civil race. They dwelt in small,
neat houses, surrounded by enclosed yards, ornamented in the
Chinese taste with gay rather than fragrant plants. The enclosures,
whilst they gave the advantages of privacy, were of sufficient extent
to admit the freest circulation of air. They opened towards the
river by a gate in a fence at right angles with the houses, which
looked towards the south. The inmates of these dwellings,
whenever they saw us at the entrance-gate, invited us in. We
frequently found them at meals in the open air, and were always
on these occasions pressed to partake of their fare, and on all
others, supplied with tea. They permitted me freely to examine
the yards and outer apartments of their houses; but never allowed
me to enter those of the interior, which were probably appropriated to
their women. Those which I had an opportunity of seeing, formed
the front of the house, and consisted of two of unequal size.
The larger, of twice the size of the other, served for general
purposes; it was an apartment for the reception of company, a
temple, and a sleeping room. Its walls Avere covered with white
paper, on which hung some rude sketches of mountain-scenery,
and some moral sentences written on silk, in large Chinese
characters. The bed places at one end of the room Avere large
massive benches of brick-work, having a small furnace beneath
them, by which they are warmed during winter. On these, with
no other defence from their hardness than a felt mat, the Chinese
sleep. But the most striking piece of furniture, if it may be so
called, was a temple in miniature. It much resembled at first sight
cases of shell-work, which are sometimes seen in houses in England,
and are called grottos. It was seldom more than two or three
feet square, and was generally placed against the wall a few feet
from the ground, nearly opposite to the entrance-door. In its
centre was a figure of an ill-proportioned, corpulent old man,
plentifully besmeared with gilding, and red and white paint, and
surrounded with strings of round pieces of tinfoil, which the Chinese
<!-- Leaf 159, Page: 121 -->
burn in their sacrifices. Chairs and tables of varnished wood
clumsy in form and materials, completed the furniture of the
apartment.


The smaller room was a kitchen, which did not display a very
complicated apparatus, having only a square brick furnace
supporting two large iron bowls, that served for baking, boiling, or
any other similar purpose.


The Chinese appeared to have confined their attempts at
ornament to their yards, which contained plants of various species.
The elegant Ipomœa quamoclet, trained on small frames of trellis
work, was, from its frequent culture, obviously a favourite. The
Begonia Evansiana*T, ALargerstrœmia indica, Hemorocallisjaponica, Punica
granatum dwarfed, Cassia sophora, Nerium oleander, Lychnis coronata,
Tradescantia cristata, were abundantly cultivated in pots, together
with a species of Dianella, with purple flowers, of Hibiscus, and of
Plumbago, Avhich I could not determine. But cultivated and prized
above all others, appeared the Nelumbium speciosum, the Lien-wha
of the Chinese. This splendid flower, celebrated for its beauty by the
Chinese poets, and ranked for its virtues among the plants Avhich,
acaccording to Chinese theology, enter into the beverage j - of immortality,
flourished in the greatest vigour in the gardens of Tung-Chow. It
was raised in capacious vases of water, containing gold and silver
fish, supported on stands a few feet from the ground. These were
surrounded by steps of different elevation, supporting other plants
mingled with artificial rocks, representing a hilly country and
covered with diminutive houses, pagodas, and gardens. In this
situation the Nelumbium was certainly an object of exceeding beauty. Its
tulip-like blossoms of many petals tinted with the most delicate
pink, hung over its fan-like leaves, floated on the surface of the
water, or rising on long footstalks of unequal height, bent them

  R
<!-- Leaf 160, Page: 122 -->
into elegant curves, and shaded with graceful festoons the plants
beneath.


The Nelumbium is used by the Chinese to decorate lakes and
other ornamental Avater, and to give a charm and productiveness to
marshes otherwise unsightly and barren. Near Yuen-Ming-Yuen,
and under the Avails of Pekin, I saw it covering Avith pink and
yelloAV blossoms large tracts of land, and could sympathise Avith
the enthusiasm of the Chinese bards, Avho have sung of the delight
of moonlight excursions on rivers covered with the floAvering
Lien-wha.* Its seeds, in size and form like a small acorn without
its cup, are eaten green or dried as nuts, and are often preserved
as sweetmeats : they have a nut-like flavour. Its roots, sometimes
as thick as the arm, of a pale green Avithout and whitish within,
in a raw state are eaten as fruit, being juicy and of a SAveetish and
refreshing flavour; and when boiled, are served as Aregetables. Both
seeds and roots were frequently sent with the dessert to the
Ambassador's table: the former were relished by us, but the latter Avere
too fibrous to be eaten with pleasure. The leaves are said to
possess a strengthening quality; the seed vessel to cure the colic,
to facilitate parturition, and to counteract the effects of poison.


The Nelumbium is readily raised by the Chinese in all parts of
the empire through Avhich we passed, but seemed to flourish better
in the northern than the southern provinces; and, according to
the Missionaries, grows most luxuriantly beyond the great wall.
I Avas unable to obtain much information respecting its culture,
and none that was new. It does not appear that much art is used.
Its leaves are watered in the summer, and cut down close to
the roots on the approach of winter.


The inhabitants were very liberal in their gifts of cultivated plants,
allowing me to select specimens for drying; and whenever I
expressed a wish to possess living ones, they readily gave them to me.

Presents in return were always acceptable, and sometimes expected;
and of these, black-lead pencils, and common English writing-paper,
Avere much valued.


From the gardens I obtained the greater number of the botanical
specimens that I collected in the neighbourhood of Tung-Chow,
No country could be more barren in uncultivated plants. The
species of Polyganum, before-mentioned as growing on the banks of
the Pei-ho, were here also common, together with the Hibiscus trionum,
Lycium Chinense*, Tribulus terrestris\, and a species of Jrtemesia.
The Sophora jajjonicaX, growing to a large size, was seen in the
gardens, and often by the road-side, and was obviously prized for its
beauty.


The plants cultivated for their esculent or other useful properties,
were numerous in proportion to those which were wild. As Chinese
corn, the Holcus sorghum, and a species of Panicum, were the most
abundant. The former frequently grew to sixteen feet in height.
Its large bunchy panicles were ripening fast whilst Ave remained at
Tung-Chow. The seed of this plant is sown in rows on the margin
of rivers, in a stiff soil; and Avhen it begins to rise through tl\e ground,
the more humble Panicum, which ripens after its tall neighbour is
cut doAvn, is sown betAveen them. Its seeds are fully developed


* I have called this plant Chinense because it appears to be the same which has received
that specific appellation from botanists; but I was entirely unable to observe any difference,
except in the occasional size of the leaves, between it and Lycium barbarian of Linnæus.
It is a most abundant plant on the banks of the rivers in the province of Pe-tchee-lee.


f This plant is equally abundant on the banks of the Pei-ho and Eu-ho, in the
province of Pe-tchee lee. The character, " foliola sex-jugata," given to this plant by its
describers, does not at all apply to it as found by me in the north of China. Like T.
cistoides, it has always " foliola octo-jugata," and only differs from that plant in the
smallness of its corolla.


\ Most of the trees which 1 observed in the precincts of Yuen-Ming-Yuen, had
pinnated leaves, and were, I suspect, chiefly the Sophora japonica. I may here observe,
that in giving some account of thc plants which I found in China, I by no means wish it
to be understood that I mention all that I either saw or collected. I only name those of
which I have some memorandum, which I distinctly recollect, or of which I have
recovered specimens.

before the tall corn is reaped, and only requires the solar light and
heat, till then excluded, to ripen. The Polygonum fagopyrum is also
cultivated as grain, but generally occurred in patches in the
neighbourhood of cottages. These three plants seemed to afford the principal
farinaceous support to the people inhabiting the banks of the Pei-ho.
The Sesamum orientate, and the Ricinus communis, or Castor oil plant,
Avere much cultivated for the esculent oils extracted from their seeds.

The Chinese use, I suspect, some means of depriving the oil of this
plant of its purgative properties; but that they do not entirely
succeed, Chinese habits enabled me to observe, in every field or pathway
that I entered between Tien-sing and Tung-Chow. The seeds,
Avhich are also eaten, occasion, no doubt, the same effects as the oil
extracted from them.


Of the plants cultivated as vegetables, the principal were the
Solatium melongena, two species of Capsicum*, the Sweet Potatoe, seA-eral
species of Gourds and Cucumbers, one or two species of Phaseolus,
or kidney-bean, of which they boil the young plants, and aboAre all,
the vegetable called by the Chinese Petsai f, a species of cabbage.


The Petsai is quite a national plant. The quantity consumed
of it all over the Chinese empire, but in Pekin especially, is
immense; the nine gates of this city, according to some authors,
being frequently choked by various vehicles laden with it, which
pass through them daily from morning till night during the months
of October and November. This vegetable may in fact be
considered in relation to the Chinese Avhat the potatoe is to the Irish. It
is prized by all classes, and esteemed by them as a necessary of
life. It is cultivated all over the empire, and receives a greater share
of horticultural labour and skill than any other plant. In rearing
it, the Chinese consume an enormous quantity of their celebrated


The Capsicum Sinensc, and Capsicum Annuun, the latter quite as commonly as the
former.

f Pe, white, tsai, vegetable; so named, probably, because the Chinese blanch the plant,

manure, called by them Ta Few*, composed chiefly of human
ordure.


This plant, which I have eaten as a salad, and found equal to any
lettuce, has somewhat the flavour, when boiled, of asparagus. It
often weighs from fifteen to twenty pounds, and reaches the height
of two or three feet. The Chinese preserve it during the winter
by different methods : many pickle it in salt and vinegar; others keep
it fresh, either by planting it in large quantities in wet sand, at the
bottom of trenches cut for the purpose, or after drying it in the
sun, by burying it deep in the earth. Those who wish to preserve
it for a short time only, place it two or three feet beneath the
surface, covering it Avith a layer of straw and earth, f


Of the many species of fruit brought to the Ambassador's table
at Tung-Chow, I saw very few growing. Indeed, I can only mention
a very fine white grape, generally cultivated in the gardens, water
and other melons, the Lien-wha, and peach. We were, however,
amply supplied with apples and chesnuts, an esculent seed of a
pine said to come from Tartary, and the seed of the Taxus nucifera.


Among the plants raised for other purposes than those yet named,
the Sida tiliæfolia %, the Xing ma § of the Chinese, was the most
conspicuous. This plant is extensively cultivated on the banks of the
Pei-ho, in the neighbourhood of Tung-chow, for the manufacture of
cordage formed of its fibre. It is not indeed the universalcordage* Of this manure and its application I shall elsewhere give some account.


f A full account of the manner of rearing and preserving this vegetable is given in
Memoires concernant les Chinois, torn. iv.


X Willdenow has described the Sida tiliæfolia under the division of the genus "pedunculis
unifloris," a character not at first sight belonging to it, since the peduncles often divide
into several others, each bearing a flower; but each subdivision has a small leaf, which,
in a more advanced age of the plant, renders the character strictly applicable.


§ Xing ma. The character ma signifies any plant whose seed is esculent, and whose
fibre can be made into rope.  
  
  
  *e3
<!-- Leaf 164, Page: 126 -->
plant of the Chinese, but seems to be chiefly confined to the northern
provinces. They have another plant also used for the
manufacture of rope, called by them Ge ma, which is, I believe, the
Cannabis sativa. The cordage made from the Cannabis is most
prized by Europeans, but that formed from the Sida is, I suspect,
preferred by the Chinese. I am led to this conclusion by having
observed the two plants cultivated together at Tung-Chow, the Sida in
long ridges or in fields, like the millet, and the Cannabis in small
patches. I had no opportunity of seeing the manufacture of the Sida;
but the rope made from it, in colour, softness, and fineness,
resembles the dressed fibre of several West Indian Sidas prepared by
Dr. Wright, and placed, with their respective plants, in the herbarium
of Sir Joseph Banks. The root of the Sida is used according to
the Missionaries*, as a powerful sudorific; but as their information
is derived from the Chinese, who attribute medicinal properties to
almost all plants, it cannot in this instance be much relied on.


From the number of plants cultivated at Tung-Chow, my readers
may be disposed to imagine that every foot of ground was rendered
productive. This, however, Avould be an erroneous conclusion.
Variety seemed to have taken place of quantity. It appeared as if
the soil was capable of bearing no extensive crop of any one kind,
but was of a different quality in different spots, and adapted to
the growth of different kinds. Thus, on the borders of the river, I
often found millet; and not a hundred yards beyond, the Sida; and,
still farther, the Gossipium, and then a barren marsh; but this series
had no fixed law except with respect to the millet, which always
lined the banks of the river Avhen not of a sandy nature. In this
mode of cultivation the Chinese had shown some ingenuity and
industry; but I could never find, here or elsewhere, that they
throw extensive tracts of land into general cultivation; still less, that  
  
  
  * Lettres Edifiantes et Curieuscs, torn. xxi. p. 30.
<!-- Leaf 165, Page: 127 -->
they modify its surface by any complicated process of a durable
result. In short, vvhatever observations I have been able to make on
the state of their land, lead me to the conclusion, that, " as
horticulturists, they may perhaps be allowed a considerable share of merit;
but, on the great scale of agriculture, they are not to be mentioned
with many European nations."


Circumstances have deprived me of the power of giving any
detailed account of many insects which I had an opportunity of
collecting at Tung-ChoAV. My memory only permits me to state,
generally, that the Scarabœus molossus, Cerambyx farinosus, frequented
the corn-fields; and that the mole cricket Gryllus gryllotalpha of a
large size, entered the windows of our boats as soon as candles
Avere lighted in the evening, and was occasionally found in our
beds.


During our stay at Tung-Chow, much sickness occurred in the
Embassy, but its severe forms were confined to the band and
guard. The complaints were chiefly dysenteric and inflammatory;
the former arising, I apprehend, in a good measure, from the nature
of the waters of the Pei-ho; the latter, from the habits of the men
and the nature of their situation on board the boats.


The water of the river had, from the time of leaving Ta-koo, given
unequivocal proofs of its noxious effects on the digestive organs of
every one, but especially of those who were at all prone to their
disorders. To its effects in this respect I attribute, in some measure,
the death of one of the men of His Lordship's band, whose name was
Pybus, and who was remarkable for a mild and grateful disposition.
He had been attacked with dysentery on board the Alceste, had been
in great danger, but had so far recovered as to join his companions
with eagerness on His Lordship's disembarkation. After entering the
Pei-ho all his symptoms returned with increased severity, and
terminated his existence on the day previous to our departure for
YuenMing-Yuen. He was buried with military honours in a Chinese
burial ground, Avhich had received the remains of his countryman
Eade, one of the followers of Lord Macartney.
<!-- Leaf 166, Page: 128 -->

The difference of temperature and moisture of the day and night,
which Avas considerable Avhilst we remained at Tung-ChoAV, had a
direct tendency to induce inflammatory disease; and, aided by
imprudence in bathing at mid-day under a hot sun, and too great, though
by no means intemperate potation, of the ardent spirits of the Chinese,
occasioned two or three severe cases of inflammation of the bowels

and lungs in the guard and band. Should any circumstances ever
again carry an Embassy to Tung-Chow, it would be better for all its
members to sleep, if possible, on shore. The exhalations of the
river, charged with all kinds of effluvia produced by the uncleanly
habits of a large population living on the water, and the decomposing
vegetable and animal matter ejected from the boats, will thus be
avoided. Those also who are too ignorant correctly to estimate the
effect of any particular habit will be thus within the reach of persons
who may be able to control them. No sufficient accommodation
having, on our arrival at Tung-Chow, been provided for the whole
of His Lordship's guard and band, many of them were obliged to
live in their boats, and were in consequence enabled to indulge their
propensities to what they considered enjoyment, without fully
benefiting from the intelligent regulations of their commanding officer.
His Lordship's guard deseiwe, however, this tribute of praise, that
they conducted themselves, from the time of entering the Chinese
empire to that of leaving it, with undeviating propriety in every duty
connected with their particular situation; and Avere only untractable
in what concerned their own health.


The water of the Pei-ho, when first taken up, is of a milky colour,
and holds a considerable quantity of earthy matter in suspension. The
Chinese precipitated this, in some degree, by agitating the water
with a piece of aluni enclosed in the end of a bamboo, but did not
deprive it entirely of its noxious properties. Drip stones, under
these and similar circumstances, Avould have been invaluable to us.
We often considered a draught of pure water, in the interior of China,
as great a luxury as it usually is to those who have been some weeks

Fahrenheit's thermometer, whilst we remained at Tung-Chow,
from the 20th of August to the 2d of September, stood frequently
in the shade during the day at 88°, once rose to 93°, and never
fell below 83°. In the night it generally sunk to 72° and 70°, giving
rise to a sensation of cold quite inexplicable by a reference to the
absolute temperature.

  CHAPTER V.

On the morning of the 2d of September, the boats of the Embassy
having quitted their anchorage before Tung-Chow, we commenced a
four months' journey through the Empire of China to Canton. On
retracing our way to Tien-sing, we had feAv motives and little
inclination to keep within the bounds prescribed to our rambles by the
Chinese, and soon found, in exceeding them, that they quietly
acquiesced in what they could not, without some trouble, prevent. But
we met with little novelty by extending the range of our investigation.
The same description of inhabitants, dwellings, and produce that I had
occasion to describe on our route to Tung-Chow, was found equally on
the banks of the river and beyond them, when all was not marsh.
I added but very few plants to my former meagre collection, and of
these I am only able to mention the Ulmus pumila, growing in dry
barren places; a species of Orobanche*; and the Viola tricolor.


The apprehension of the junior part of the croAvds, who as usual
assembled about me from the huts or villages in the vicinity of my
walks, was in a great degree worn off; but their anxiety to assist me
in my pursuits was undiminished. Their elders, especially Avhen
they were peasants, afforded a pleasing contrast in their simple
manners and civil treatment of strangers, to the cunning designs of the
salesmen of Tung-Chow, and the brutal importunity of the courtiers
of Yuen-Ming-Yuen. When they have accompanied me along the
banks of the river, far in advance of my boat, and have beheld me
overcome by fatigue and heat, they have always appeared anxious to
relieve my distress. One has hastened to the nearest house for a seat,


* I had no doubt at the time of gathering this plant that it was the Orobanche cœrulea,
but I have since had no opportunity of verifying the specific name.
<!-- Leaf 169, Page: 131 -->
another has brought me water, and a third has held an umbrella over
my head to defend me from the sun, whilst their companions have at
some distance formed a circle around me. We were to these people as
the inhabitants of another world. Our features, dress, and habits were
so opposed to theirs, as to induce them to infer that our country, in
all its natural characters, must equally differ from their own. " Have
you a moon, and rain, and rivers in your country ?" were their
occasional questions. Comprehending no other rational object for the
collecting of plants than their useful qualities, and seeing me gather
all indiscriminately, they at once supposed that I sought them merely
as objects of curiosity, and laughed heartily at my eagerness to obtain
them. They pitied my ignorance, and endeavoured to teach me
their relate worth, and were anxious for me to learn the important
truth, that from one seed many might be obtained. A young man
having shaken some ripe seeds from the capsules of the Sesamum
and the Sida, described to me, with much minuteness, that if I took
them to my own country, and put them into the ground, they would
produce many plants, and I might thus in time obtain the blessing
of good rope and oil.


We arrived at Tien-sing on the 6th. During the delay of the
Embassy for two days at this city, Mr. Griffith and myself obtained
permission from our conductor Chang to enter a part of it, from
which, during our former visit to this place, we had been excluded.
An officer who superintended our boats was appointed to attend us,
to guard against the imposition of tradesmen; but he gave us great
reason to suspect that he either wished to partake of the profits
resulting from our bargains, or to prevent our purchasing altogether,
by inducing the people to put an exorbitant price on their goods.*


* The conduct of the Chinese soldiers, in enhancing the pi*ice of goods to a stranger,
resembles that of the Janissaries in Turkey. Dr. Clarke tells us, that strangers visiting
the shops of Constantinople, attended by a Janissary, pays for every article a price
augmented in the proportion of the sum " privately exacted by the Janissary as his share
of the profit."—Travels in various Countries of Europe, Asia, and Africa. Part the
Second, p. 34.  
  
  
  s 2
<!-- Leaf 170, Page: 132 -->
It appeared, indeed, as if the people of Tien-sing, having observed
us carrying scarcely any other money about than dollars, supposed
them of as little value to us as their copper coin; for they offered
no article to our purchase whose price was not given in dollars,
although its real value was only a few Tchen. This
circumstance was the more provoking, as we met with several specimens
of Chinese ingenuity which we were not likely to obtain
elsewhere. Those contained in the shops of the lapidaries tempted
us the most, and raised our admiration the highest. In these we
found a variety of the hardest stones, cut into singular and
sometimes rather beautiful forms. The stone called by the Chinese Yu
Avas, in their estimation, the most precious. It has been famed in
China from the earliest ages, having, according to the antiquarians
of the country, been distinctly described a thousand years before the
Christian era.* It is of various colours, passing from white, with
the slightest tinge of green, through green of every degree of
intensity; and also occurs, according to the Chinese, of a clear blue,
sky-blue, an indigo-blue, and of a citron-yellow and orange-yellow
colour. But I suspect that they confound several species of stone
under the name Yu. Their blue stone may be lapis lazuli, and
their yellow, varieties of chalcedony and carnelian, all which I
have frequently met with in China.


The Missionaries tell us, and I received precisely the same account
of its green varieties, that the Yu is found in the form of nodules in
the bottoms of ravines, and in the beds of torrents, in mountainous
countries, and in larger masses in the mountains themselves,
especially in Yu-nan.-i* The nodules are more prized by the Chinese than
the large masses, which have the coarsest grain. Whatever specimens
are found must be subjected to the selection of the Emperor before
they are carried to the market. Of the green, the Chinese prize that

f One of the most northern provinces of the empire. According to Du Haide, it is
one of the richest and most extensive; containing twenty-one cities of the first order, and
fifty-five of the second and of the third. Du Haide, Fol. torn. i. p. 243.
<!-- Leaf 171, Page: 133 -->
most which is whitest: of this was formed the sceptre sent from the
Emperor to His Royal Highness the Prince Regent.


The Yu, although of the hardness of rock crystal, is worked
into an endless variety of forms; into beautifully carved rings,
Avorn on the thumbs of archers to defend them from the friction
of the boAv-string; into fine chains, cups, and vases. Yet so
refractory is this substance to the tools used in its manufacture by the
Yu-tsiang, or workers in Yu, who succeed each other in their
labours night and day in the imperial palace, that many of the forms
into which it is wrought require, according to the Missionaries, ten
years for their completion. That much time, infinite patience, and
great ingenuity are sometimes expended in working it, I could not
doubt, when I held in my hand a small vase which I found in a shop
at Tien-sing. It was formed from one entire mass of greenish white
Yu. * The handle represented a lizard, with all its characters
minutely displayed. Figures of the same animal were sculptured in
high relief on its sides, some craAvling up, and others overlooking
the rim of the vessel. Whatever part of the exterior surface they left
unoccupied, was filled with ancient Chinese characters deeply engraved.
Its price was one hundred and twenty Spanish dollars; or, according
to the value of silver in China, upAvards of thirty guineas. The
partiality of the Chinese for this stone seemed to me quite
unaccountable, from any quality that it exhibited to my observation. It
is generally of a dull, sometimes of a muddy colour, and does not
admit so high a polish as agate.


The greenish white variety of the Yu has long been known in this
country under the name of Chinese Jade or Nephrite, but has lately
been classed with Prehnite. f I am disposed, however, to believe that
it will be found an undescribed species, but closely allied to axestone.
Its analysis, which can alone determine its nature, I have had no


* Of their manner of working this stone I could obtain no information in China; but
there can be little doubt that they use largely the powder of the Corundum, or Adamantine
Spar, which they employ in Canton in cutting lenses for spectacles from rock crystal.  
  
  
  f Jameson's Mineralogy, 2d edition, vol. i. p. 505. note.
<!-- Leaf 172, Page: 134 -->
opportunity of making; but such of its characters as I have been
able to mark, are given in a note at the foot of this page. *


The other stones which I observed in Tien-sing were chiefly agate
and pudding-stone, worked into large rings for the wrists,
ornaments for the women's hair in shape like a skewer, and snuff-bottles.
These last, formed also of amber, porcelain, and imitations of stone,
resemble in shape the smelling-bottles of the ladies of England; but
have a small spoon, like that of a Cayenne pepper-bottle, fastened to
the stopples, for the purpose of taking out the snuff.


The curiosity of the people of Tien-sing seemed to have been in
no degree diminished by their first opportunity of seeing the English
tribute-bearers, and was manifested, much to our annoyance, in our
visit to the city. The crowds who had been so orderly and silent
during our procession to partake of the imperial banquet, being now
unrestrained by authority, flocked about us, and Avere not more
forbearing than others of their countrymen.


No circumstance arrests the eye of a stranger in the cities of
China more than the great number of barbers, who are met with in
its streets and form a considerable proportion of every crowd. Why
they are so numerous, is readily explained by a reference to the
universal custom amongst the Chinese, of shaving all but the crown

of the head, and of eradicating every straggling hair from the
face, especially from the ears, eyes, and nostrils; and to their
practice of shampooing : a single operation, consequently, occupying so
much time, that one man cannot serve many employers in a day.
The barbers carry about with them all the necessary implements of
their avocation; a stool, a small furnace, Avater, razors, and brushes,
comprised in tAvo small stands, suspended from the two ends of a
bamboo, supported across the shoulders. Besides these, they have
a variety of small instruments made of white copper, the forms of
which tell little of their appropriate uses. My readers may amuse
themselves in conjecturing them, from their sac-simile
representation in the annexed engraving. I could only observe that
they were flourished with great rapidity about the face of the
patient. They were probably used in the process of shampooing,
of which the following curious account is given by one who
underwent it: " Shampooing is an operation not known in Europe, and is
peculiar to the Chinese, which I had once the curiosity to go through,
and for which I paid but a trifle. However, had I not seen several
China merchants shampooed before me, I should have been very
apprehensive of danger, even at the sight of all the different
instruments that were arranged in proper order on the table before the
operator began. He first placed me in a large chair; then began to
beat, with both his hands, very fast upon all parts of my body. He
next stretched out my arms and legs, and gave them several sudden
pulls that racked my joints; then got my arm upon his shoulder, and
hauled me sideways a good Avay over the chair, and as suddenly gave
my head a twitch or jerk round, that I thought he should have put
my neck out of joint. Next, he beat, Avith the ends of his fingers,
very softly, but very quickly, all over my head, body, and legs, every
now and then cracking his fingers with an air; then he stroaked up
my ears, temples, and eye-lashes; and again racked my joints. After
he had gone through this process, he proceeded Avith his instruments
to scrape, pick, and syringe my ears, every now and then tinkling
with an instrument close to my ears. The next thing was my eyes,
<!-- Leaf 174, Page: 136 -->
into which I patiently suffered several small instruments to be thrust
and turned about, by which operation he brought away half a
tea-cupfull of hot, waterish stuff. He next proceeded to scraping, paring,
and cleaning the nails of my fingers and toes; and then to cutting my
corns. I only wanted to have had a lock of hair plaited, to complete
the operation. But after he had spent half an hour with me, it ended
here, for which I gave him to the A^alue of a penny. He departed
well satisfied, and afterwards called several mornings." *


Their razors looked clumsy and inconvenient; but I can state
from experience, that their edge is keen, and that they are used
by expert manipulators. At the commencement of an illness that
required the shaving of my head, I was induced by curiosity to
commit myself to the hands of a Chinese barber; and at a more advanced
period of my disorder, put myself for the same purpose under another
of the fraternity, after suffering from the inferior skill of one of my
countrymen.

jgg DEPARTURE FROM TIEN-SING.


Leaving Tien-sing on the morning of the 8th of September, we
quitted the Pei-ho and entered the Eu-ho or imperial river, called also
the Yun-Leang-ho, or the grain-bearing river. The stream running two
miles an hour against us, made our progress very slow for several
days. We were forced against it by trackers who were often deserting,
and replaced by any passing Chinese whose situation of life did not
absolutely exempt them from the authority of our attendant
Mandarins.


The country on the banks of the river varied much in character,
but generally exhibited a greater number of highly fertile spots than
in the same space we had seen on the Pei-ho. The " tall corn" no
longer skirted their margin, but was chiefly seen in the back ground.
Fields of petsai, garlic, and capsicum, gently sloped to the water's
edge, in front of houses built of brick, and covered with a roof of clay.
Buildings half-buried in the shade of trees occasionally variegated
the distant prospect.


In visiting the cottages within the reach of my rambles, I was
much interested by the appearance of the means of independent
support possessed by many of their inhabitants. Millet, petsai,
and the oil of sesamum, constitute in a good measure the ordinary
fare of the lower classes in the north of China. All these were
frequently growing around small huts, containing a mill for grinding
the corn and expressing the oil, with all the subsidiary apparatus.
The mill was put in motion by an ass, yoked to the end of a long
arm fixed in the uppermost of the two circular stones of which it
was composed.


I witnessed the different processes necessary to the preparation of
the oil going on in different parts of the same cottage at the same
time. A large quantity of the seed of the sesamum having been put into
an iron pan, over a small brick furnace, was constantly stirred with an
iron shovel till the whole had been sufficiently roasted. It was
then transferred into a conical basket, placed in the centre of the
upper stone. Shaken from a hole in the side of the basket by the
motion of the mill, it passed through an aperture in the middle of
<!-- Leaf 177, Page: 139 -->
the upper stone to the surface of the lower one, where, being ground,
it gave out the oil. This flowed over the lower stone into a reservoir
below it. Here ended the process of expression; but another
commenced, the intention of which I could not so well understand: it
was probably connected with some mode of purifying the oil. I
mention it chiefly as an example of the simple, and what may perhaps be
called, domestic methods, sometimes in use Avith the Chinese, to
diminish the degree of manual labour. A quantity of oil recently
taken from the mill, and contained in a wide shallow vessel, was
continually agitated by a large copper pestle, with which a lad gently
struck its surface. The fatigue that would otherwise have arisen
from the weight of the pestle and uniform motion of the arm in using
it, was prevented by the following very simple contrivance : A small
bow of bamboo being fastened to the ceiling immediately over the
vessel containing the oil, the pestle was fastened to its string in the
manner shown in the wood engraving. Thus suspended, it received
from the slightest touch an adequate impulse; whilst the elasticity of
the bamboo gave it the necessary recoil.

Near the same cottage, chance led me to the shop of a
blacksmith, the manufacturer of various iron instruments, from a sword to
a hoe. This man well understood the modifying properties of heat,
and took the fullest advantage of them in all the practical concerns of
his business. He was forming a reaping-hook at the time of my
visit. A large pair of shears, having one blade fixed in a heavy block
of wood, and the other furnished with a long handle to act as a lever,
stood beside him. Bringing a piece of metal of the necessary
dimensions from the forge, at a white heat, he placed it between the blades
of this instrument, and cut it into shape with equal ease and despatch.
This blacksmith, like all other Chinese manufacturers whom I saw at
work, seemed proud of displaying his art to a stranger.


The desire of testifying my sense of the civilities I received by
the offer of small presents, was sometimes an irksome feeling, from
the difficulty of selecting those which were proper. Silver coin
would, in every instance, have been the most acceptable; but the
number of claimants rendered it too expensive a medium of
general remuneration. Our small articles of hardware did not
seem to be much valued. Our pen-knives, especially, were
ridiculed as very useless toys. Razors were not much esteemed. Our
polished scissars were, however, eagerly received. These were,
in general form, like their own, and could be used for similar
purposes, but were infinitely more elegantly shaped and finished.
I cannot describe the delight of an old woman, an inmate of my
boat, on my putting a pair into her hands. She saluted me with
the chin-chin for many days afterwards whenever she saw me.* But
my scissars were soon exhausted; and I should have been puzzled
to substitute any adequate form of donation, if I had not fortunately


* I can have no doubt that the Chinese would much more highly prize instruments
made from their own models, but of more durable materials, and of better construction,
than any made for European use. They would speak at once to their understanding. The
use of our instruments, on the contrary, they cannot comprehend; and what they do not
comprehend, they always believe to be absurd.
<!-- Leaf 179, Page: 141 -->
ascertained the excessive fondness of all classes of the Chinese for snuff.
Sir George Staunton having put in my possession several bottles
of Brasil snuff, which they prefer to any other, I always started on
my excursions furnished Avith a good supply, in small packets, and
found them accepted as a sufficient and grateful reward for any
service. It was highly amusing to see the eagerness with which any
one who had just obtained a packet was assaulted by those about
himThe instant the paper was opened, thumbs and fingers from all
quarters speedily emptied its contents. Although the Chinese would in
this way take it from their companions, I could never persuade
them to do so with me. They would shake it into their hands from
the paper or box, but would never take it out of either with their
fingers.


It was necessary, in giving any thing to the common class of
people, to watch our opportunity when the soldiers who attended us
were off their guard. Whenever they observed us offering any thing
to their countrymen, they, by some sign or other, informed them that
it Avas their property; and when once their basilisk look had taken
effect, the victim durst not attempt to appropriate the gift. Of this
influence I had several striking proofs. In passing from one
bank of the river to the other, I often employed any poor waterman
whose boat I chanced to meet with; but I do not recollect an instance
of his being able to secure the slight payment he received from the
rapacity of my guard. In one instance I obliged the soldier who
crossed with me to land before me, and then gave poor Charon his
fare, and made signs for him to push his boat from the shore. I
thought he had done so, and walked off, keeping the soldier before
me; but had not proceeded far, when my attention having been for a
few minutes attracted by some plants, I missed the soldier; and on
looking for him, saw him robbing the poor wretch, who had not
dared to quit the spot on which I had landed. I could with all my
heart have sent the soldier to the bottom of the river. But any
violent expression of rage, on such an occasion, would only have
been repaid tenfold on the unfortunate object for whose sake it had
<!-- Leaf 180, Page: 142 -->
been exerted. There could be no doubt, from the resigned manner in
which the exactions of the soldiers were endured, and the public
manner in which they were committed, that these infamous acts
were sanctioned by their paternal government.


I have now reached that part of my narrative at which I must
cease, for some time, to depend on my own journal for an account
of the progress of the Embassy, and the nature of the country
through which it passed.


On the 12th of September, after a long Avalk in an ardent sun, I
was attacked with a sudden affection of the brain, which confined
me to bed for several weeks. My suffering was great, but received
all the alleviation that friendship and benevolence could bestow.
I must not here pause to tell how much I owe to the skill of my
medical attendants, my friend Mr. Pearson and Dr. Lynn; or to the
numberless kind attentions of His Excellency, and all the gentlemen
of his suite; but I must be allowed to declare, that all the purposes
of my appointment as naturalist were largely answered during my
illness through the exertion of my friends. I may venture to affirm,
that no vegetable or mineral production of China occurred within
their reach that was not placed in my collection, with such notices
as were sufficient to determine their habits and localities. Indeed
such was the amount of my collections through these means, that I
looked forward to giving a full account of the geological and
botanical characters of the soil gone over by the Embassy during my
illness, as well as in other parts of its progress. This hope was
blasted by the shipwreck of the Alceste. I must now confine myself
to such notices of the plants and rocks of China, as are afforded
by the memoranda remaining to me, and the few duplicates I have
recovered through the kindness of Sir George Staunton and my friend
Captain Basil Hall.


With respect to the history of the progress of the Embassy during
my incapacity to observe, my readers will have little to regret, if 1
do justice to the materials which the liberality of my friends has
placed in my hands. To Mr. Morrison and Mr. Cook I shall be
<!-- Leaf 181, Page: 143 -->
chiefly indebted for my facts from the period of my illness to that of
my recovery.


The Embassy having continued to pass through a country uniformly
flat, but becoming more and more marshy, arrived on the borders of
Shan-tung on the evening of the 16th, and anchored at the town of
Sang-yuen.


In quitting the province of Pe-tchee-lee, I had added very few
specimens to my former collection of plants. The Salsola altissima,
Euphorbia tithymaloides, Lepidium latifolium, Hedysarum striatum,
Lonicera caprifolia, Pontederia vaginata, Menyanthes nymphoides,
constituted the greater number of the plants brought to me after leaving

Tien-sing.


Our conductors, Chang and Yin, left us at Sang-yuen,
relinquishing their charge to other officers. They had both ingratiated
themselves so far in our good opinion, that we parted from them Avith
regret. They were men of different characters. Chang, under an
appearance of indifference for every thing European, was anxious to
become acquainted with some of our most useful manufactures. He
particularly admired our glass and plated goods; and in a conversation
with me, through the medium of Mr. Morrison, asked many questions
respecting them. After satisfying him on these points, I took
advantage of this opportunity to tell him that we had metals which, on
coming in contact with water, burst into flame. I had some
potassium with me, and was desirous of showing its properties to him.
He immediately inquired respecting its uses; and when these could
not be very satisfactorily explained to him, looked too contemptuously
to induce me to venture an experiment.


In return for my answers to his questions, Chang freely gave me
true or false statements on any subject that excited my curiosity.
After his evasion respecting the sick, I could not avoid receiving his
information with much suspicion, and soon found fresh reason to
suppose him fallacious from principle. Having put many questions
to him about the localities of several stones, amongst others, the Yu
which he wore in his girdle, he rightly concluded that I should
<!-- Leaf 182, Page: 144 -->
consider any specimen of the kind a very interesting present; and sent
me, the next day, what he wished me to suppose a stone snuff-bottle,
but which was only a very rude imitation of blood-stone in glass.


Yin, an old soldier, with ruddy complexion and laughing eyes, cared
very little about the arts or sciences of his own or any other country.
The only produce of Europe that seemed to interest his attention was
port-wine or cherry-brandy; differing, in his taste for the former, from
most of his countrymen.


The judge of Pe-tchee-lee, who had accompanied the Embassy from
Tung-Chow, also left it at Sang-yuen. This man, a Tartar by birth,
professed a great knowledge of Europe, obtained from books
published in the Chinese language by the Missionaries; and took an
opportunity of displaying it, in a conversation Avith Mr. Morrison,
the day before he took leave of the Embassy. England, he said, was
divided into four parts; and wished to know if it had four kings.
He was rather supercilious in his remarks on the small extent of
Great Britain, compared with other countries; and especially with
China. " Your country is very small; our's (appealing to Chang,
who was present,) is too large; it is very difficult to govern : my civil
jurisdiction alone extends to the Gourkas." Wishing to impress his
auditors with his intimate acquaintance with the domestic affairs of
England, he observed, " All your teachers of religion wear beards;
and you have loaves of bread three or four cubits in diameter." My
reader will require no further illustration of the soundness and extent

of this gentleman's information. He Avas, however, better informed
respecting the geography and history of European states, than any
other Chinese with whom the Embassy became acquainted.


Several gentlemen, in walking through the streets at Sang-yuen,
fell in with three blind men playing on a dulcimer, a guitar, and a  
  
  
  violin. Two of them accompanied the instruments with their voice,  
  
  
  singing a duet, and keeping exact time with the tune. The harmony
was pleasing. The performers were rewarded with a small gratuity;
and on some soldiers crying out " Ko-tow," prostrated themselves,  
  
  
  and bowed their heads nine times to the ground.
<!-- Leaf 183, Page: 145 -->

The Embassy left Sang-yuen before day-light the next morning,
and entered a country generally swampy, but occasionally relieved
by small houses surrounded with plots of cultivated ground, on which
the tobacco began generally to appear. The boats anchored, at night,
at a village within a short distance of a large lake on the east bank of
the river.


On the 19th and 20th, the country assumed a more picturesque
character from the quantity of a cypress-like tree, Thuja orientalis,
which surrounded the houses and villages within view from the river.
Willows of large size also broke the monotony of the scene.


On the 21st, the Embassy passed the city of Woo-chang-hien, the
suburbs of which were remarkable for a handsome temple; and
halted, on the 22d, at the pagoda of Lin-tsing. This pagoda is
situated a mile to the north-east of Lin-tsing, and four miles from the
entrance to the grand canal. It is called, by the Chinese,
Shay-lepaou-ta *, or " a precious monument to Shay-le," or " the reliques of
Foo." This building has been restored since it was visited by Lord
Macartney's Embassy. At that period, the gentlemen who
endeavoured to examine it, " mounted Avith some difficulty upon the first of
its nine stages or roofs (for the little door on a level with the ground
Avas walled up Avith bricks); but it contained only the bare walls; not
even a staircase remained, nor any possible means of ascending to the
top; and the lower part was choked up with rubbish." f The
gentlemen of Lord Amherst's Mission ascended it by a winding staircase
of one hundred and eighty polished stone steps, leading through its
different stories. Each of these had eight windows, corresponding
with its eight sides. Their floors projected two or three feet beyond
the body of the building, forming a platform for walking above, and
a roof to the compartment beneath. The architraves and angles of


* " Les ta, espece de tour sepulchrale ou superstitieuse qui est massive, pour l'ordinaire,

  a
<!-- Leaf 184, Page: 146 -->
the roofs were ornamented with wood richly carved. Idols were
placed in niches of the walls, but were in a state of decay. Its height
was estimated at one hundred and twenty feet. From an inscription
on a tablet over the door of the building, Mr. Morrison ascertained
the date of its erection to be the 13th year of the Emperor Wan-lech,
of the Ming dynasty, answering to the year 1584 of the Christian era.


In the vicinity of the pagoda some buildings were seen, of a
different style of architecture to any before met vvith. They were of a
quadrangular form. The sides were equal, supporting a sloping roof.
This was somewhat cone-shaped; had also equal sides going off from
the corresponding walls, and rising in a point, surmounted by a round
ball. They proved to be Mahommedan mosques, called, by the
Chinese, Le-pee-tze. *


The Embassy passed the pagoda at two in the afternoon, and
anchored at the entrance of the canal about four o'clock, leaving
Lintsing to the north-east. The Eu-ho continued its course southward
across the mouth of the canal.


On the 23d, the boats entered the canal, or Cha-ho, " river of
floodgates," which at first took an easterly direction, but gradually
swept towards the south; in this respect corresponding with the
course given to it on the map of the Jesuits. It was wide at its
entrance, but after a few miles, became covered Avith rushes, which
closed the prospect on both sides.


On the 24th, the Embassy passed through several floodgates, often
contracting the width of the canal to twenty-two feet; and,
occasionally, scarcely permitting the passage of His Excellency's boat, whose
greatest breadth was about nineteen feet. All these were of the
simple construction described by former Avriters, being formed of
\"planks sliding in grooves that are cut into the sides of two stone
abutments." In the evening, the boats anchored under the suburbs
of Tang-chang-foo, distinguished by its handsome gates, square  
  
  
  * For a notice respecting the Mahommedans in China, see Appendix.
<!-- Leaf 185, Page: 147 -->
towers and great extent. Early the next morning, the first hills that
had been seen since the Embassy left Tung-Chow, were observed
rising in the south-east, and bounding an uninteresting plain of great
extent. Continuing their progress, the boats passed, on the morning
of the 28th, the mouth of the principal river which feeds the canal.
The name of this river, called by the writers of the former Embassy
Luen, is, according to Mr. Morrison, Wan; and is said to arise
from seventy-two springs in the mountain called Tae-shan, in the
province of Chan-tong. " It falls into the canal with a rapid stream,
in a line which is perpendicular to the course of the canal. A strong
bulwark of stone supports the opposite western bank; and the waters of
the river striking with force against it, part of them folloAv the northern
and part the southern course of the canal." This last circumstance has
given the name of Fan-shang-Meaou, " the temple of the division of
waters," to a religious edifice erected near the bulwark. It is also
dedicated to Lung-Wang, the dragon king, and god of seas and rivers.
From this point, as has been conjectured by Sir George Staunton*,
whose supposition is borne out by Du Haide f, the canal was
probably commenced. Whether the Wan-ho originally wound towards
the north or south, or in a line with its present direction, cannot
perhaps now be determined; but there can be no doubt that the natural
course of its waters has been altered and directed northAvard through
a channel cut to the Eu-ho, and southward, through a succession of
swamps, (in rainy seasons, lakes,) to the Yellow River. Previous to
crossing the stream of the Wan-ho, the boatmen prostrated
themselves in the temple before a table covered with yellow silk, ornamented
with the figures of dragons.

Having entered the southern division of the canal, the Embassy
proceeded, with the stream in its favour, through a succession of what
the Chinese call Hoo, or " lakes." These, which in ordinary seasons
are little else than swamps, had been swelled and united, by late
heavy rains, into a waste of water, bounded in one direction by the
horizon, in another by distant mountains. The embankments of the
canal, supported, in the time of the former Embassy, by " retaining
walls of coarse grey marble, cut into large blocks, bound together
with clamps of iron," no longer giving it the appearance of an
aqueduct much elevated above the adjoining country, were broken down
by the inundation.


Cottages half submerged, or raised on little platforms of soil,
occasionally interrupted the uniformity of the scene, which derived a very
peculiar character from the Nelumbium in fruit, which every where
appeared. Inhabitants of all ages were seen paddling about in search
of it, in small machines, more like baskets than boats. Here and
there, indeed, a more picturesque view was obtained, and enabled
Mr. Cook to take the accompanying characteristic sketch of the lake
Nan-wang.


The Embassy crossed a corner of the province of Kiang-nan on the
30th of September, 4 and re-entering the province of Shan-tong, they
next day crossed the mouth of the Sheh-tze-ho or " letter ten
river;" the Chinese characters for ten being two crossing lines.


Leaving the inundated country, and passing the mouth of the
river Koo-shan-yin, whose waters accelerated the current of the
canal, we reached, on the 3d, the borders of the province of Kiang-nan.
The country now, for some distance, altered its character. Fields
highly cultivated, and interspersed with innumerable hamlets buried
in the shade of trees, covered undulating ground on both sides of the
canal.


On the 5th, the masts and sails of vessels were seen, at no great
distance, navigating the Yellow river, parallel with the course of the
canal. This being the day of Chung-tswe-Tsee, or " full harvest
moon," the boatmen made propitiatory sacrifices to their idols. Mr.

Cook has described the ceremony that took place on board his boat.
\"The Captain having placed two portraits of his deities, in wooden
frames, on the forecastle, and arranged three cups of tea and two
bundles of lighted sandal-Avood before them, fell upon his knees,
and after thrice bowing, bent his head three times to the ground.
He then arose, and taking a lighted torch in his hand, walked round
the bow of his boat, exorcising all evil spirits. Returning to the
idols, he took up the cups, and emptied them over the side of the
vessel. He then placed his deities on a small pile of paper, and
having set the whole on fire, beat the gong till they were consumed;
an assistant at the same time discharging a volley of crackers.
Resuming his torch, he again traversed the bow of his boat; and thus
terminated the ceremony."


On the morning of the 6th, the Embassy anchored within half a
mile of the junction of the canal with the Yellow river, intending to
cross the latter on the following morning. But a favourable breeze
having sprung up soon after mid-day, the boats got under weigh, and
entering the Yellow river on the north-east side, crossed its stream
in an oblique direction, and gained the mouth of the channel destined
to receive them on the opposite shore. That part of the river crossed
by the boats was calculated to be about a mile broad, and flowed at
the rate of three miles an hour. It had its characteristic colour and
proverbial turbidness. * '''••,


The boats advanced up the channel called by the Chinese boatmen
Tae-ping-ho, about four miles, passing a large sluice-gate on their
right, through which the Avaters of the lake Hung-tse were
rushing with great violence, and anchored for the night. On the
following morning His Excellency and the gentlemen of his suite
landed, during the passage of the boats through a floodgate with a
dangerous fall. This floodgate was a short distance beyond apro
* " When they (the Chinese) speak of things that are never likely to happen, they say,
When the Yellow river shall become bright." Ogilby's China, p. 617.
<!-- Leaf 190, Page: 150 -->
jecting bulwark that divided the river at right angles; one branch
o*oing to the eastward, the other directly south, and forming the canal
on which the Embassy proceeded. The sluice was formed of very
compact masonry, and was called Tean-fei-Cha, " the lock of the
celestial lady." The fall was not more than three or four feet. The
larger boats were gradually let down by ropes, the smaller darted
down, and rushing over the opposing water, dashed up a milk-white
foam to the height of several feet. The boats advanced only six or
seven miles during the day, being delayed by the passage of the locks.


On the 8th, the Embassy passed a large town called
Tsing-Keangpoo. Near the middle of the town was a large floodgate, with an
imperial pavilion on each side of the abutment. Over their gates,
Mr. Morrison read, " The pavilion of the imperial ode;" and
supposed it probable that some of Kien-Lung's odes, made during his
journies to the south, had been cut in stone and deposited in
them. They were now used as store-houses for ropes employed
in repairing the floodgates.


Below the town, the banks of the canal were so high, and the
surrounding country so low, that the tops of houses and trees seemed
to be on a level with the eye of the spectator. The land in its
neighbourhood was well cultivated with a red and white species of
rice, millet, wheat, and vegetables, and was often Arariegated with
groves of beautiful trees. The population seemed to be crowded.
A military mandarin observed to Mr. Morrison, that the wars which
had preceded and determined the ascendancy of the reigning family
thinned the population so much that the earth produced for some
time great abundance for the remaining people; but that their
numbers had since increased to a degree producing scarcity and poverty.
The officer seemed of opinion that another war would be beneficial
to the country.


About two o'clock the Embassy passed the city of Hwae-gan-foo,
whose walls stretched about three miles along the banks of the canal.
They were not above the level of the water, and Avere in some places
in a miserable state of decay. It was impossible not to shudder at
<!-- Leaf 191 -->
  
  KAOU-YEN-CHOW. 

the consequences that would ensue by the giving way of the banks of
the canal.


On the 9th the Embassy arrived, early in the morning, at the
suburbs of Kaou-yen-chow. Several gentlemen with some difficulty
obtained an entrance to a large temple, and found two or three
hundred miserable wretches who had been confined in it all night.
An attendant mandarin stated, that the boats having been expected
the night before, these poor fellows had been pressed to track them;
and from the apprehension that they Avould not come back if
permitted to return to their homes, had been put in confinement the
preceding evening.


The temple is dedicated to the Ming-keen-ship-Avang, or " ten judges
in Hades," consisted of ten apartments; a judge presided in each,
surrounded by the ministers of punishment in the form of demons
made of clay, variously coloured and distorted into hideous forms.
Before him appeared the former inhabitants of this world, awaiting
their doom. The visit was too hasty to permit a more minute
examination of this interesting edifice.


On the night of the 10th, the Embassy passed the city of
Yangchou-fou, and anchored, on the morning of the 11th, before the
pagoda of Kao-ming-tsee. From the top of this pagoda a delightful
prospect was obtained of the surrounding country. To the
northward was seen the walls and pagodas of Yang-tchoo-foo, and the
canal winding in one place through a fertile country, in another
through a succession of lakes; to the southward appeared the city
of Kwa-tchow, and the celebrated Yang-tse-kiang stretching from
east to west, covered with a multitude of vessels, and receiving the
waters of numerous streams.


The Embassy remained at Kao-ming-tsee till the 14th, when,
having changed the boats in which they had navigated the still surface
of the canal, for others more adapted to the sea-like waves of the
Yang-tse-kiang, dropped down to the city of Qua-tchow, situated
at the entrance of that river.  
  
  
  A short distance above Qua-tchow, JSfr. Cook and other gentlemen
<!-- Leaf 192, Page: 152 -->
visited the Woo-yuen, or " the five gardens," formerly a favourite
imperial residence, and found them much in the state described by
De Guignes. * " They covered a large space of ground, one part of
Avhich was filled with pavilions, either grouped or isolated, and
communicating together by an infinite number of corridors and smaller
buildings. These were all in a ruined state. The roofs had fallen in,
and the window-frames and floors were rotten. One apartment alone
contained any thing to interest curiosity. In this a pedestal of white
marble supported a white slab inscribed with a sentence composed by
the Emperor Kien-Lung. A serpentine river had in former times
meandered through the gardens, but its bed alone remained. The
remains of several bridges still existed, one of which had been of a
curved form. Factitious rocks, of grotesque forms, the delight of the
Chinese, were scattered about in all directions, and were still in a
state of good preservation. These gardens, Avhen in perfection, must
have exhibited a good example of Chinese pleasure-grounds."


Surpassing the gardens in beauty and interest was a view obtained
of a part of the Yang-tse-kiang, in the neighbourhood of Qua-tchow.
Standing on a point of land projecting into the river, you see the
Kin-shan, or " golden hill," rising like the summit of a mountain
above the waters of the Yang-tse-kiang. Its appearance verifies the
fidelity of those singular landscapes, given in Chinese books, of
mountains insulated in the midst of rivers or lakes, and covered with houses
and temples, and trees and flowers. The sides of the Kin-shan were
clothed with trees shading houses and temples of light and fantastic
forms. On the summit a grove of pines surrounded a
magnificent pagoda which rose above them. Beyond the Golden hill
is seen the city of Chin-Keang, situated at the foot of hillsstretchinoaway southward. Their dark-green declivities, when seen by the
Embassy, formed a beautiful contrast to a camp of white tents
scattered among them, and reflecting the rays of an unclouded sun.  
  
  
  * De Guignes, torn. ii.
<!-- Leaf 193, Page: 153 -->
The Yang-tse-kiang, a league in breadth, covered with numerous
vessels of every shape and size, some laying at anchor, others plying
in all directions, forms the fore-ground of the picture.


The city of Qua-tchow did not answer the expectations raised by
its advantageous situation. Its streets exhibited no characters of
opulence, and its walls were in ruins. In the days of Kien-Lung, it
flourished under imperial favour; being situated between the Five
gardens and the Golden hill; which Avere places of his frequent resort.
A canal had been cut through the city to the point of land opposite
and nearest to the Kin-shan, to facilitate his visits. A bridge also, if
Chinese vanity could be believed, was in former times thrown from
this point to the hill itself, but had left no remains as a monument of
its existence. Since these golden days in the history of Qua-tchow,
as its governor informed Mr. Morrison, the Tung-shway, or " fortune
of the place," had gradually declined.


At Qua-tchoAAr, the Embassy ceased to navigate the imperial canal.
The descriptions given by Sir George Staunton and Mr. BarroAV of its
extent and structure, and of the characters of the country through
which it passes, correspond so well with the observations of the
persons of Lord Amherst's Mission, that I have not thought it necessary
to use the details on these points given in the Journals submitted to
my inspection.


This famous monument of industry, considered simply as a channel
of communication betAveen different parts of the empire, appears to
me to have been somewhat overrated as an example of the immense
power of human labour and of human art. In every part of its course
it passes through alluvial soil, readily penetrated by the tools of
workmen, and is intersected by numerous streams. It would be
difficult to find any part of it carried through tAventy miles of country,
unaided by tributary rivers. The sluices which keep its necessary
level, are of the rudest construction : buttresses formed of blocks
of stone, Avith grooves fitted with thick planks, are the only locks of  
  
  
  x
<!-- Leaf 194, Page: 154 -->
the imperial canal. It is neither carried through any mountain or
over any valley. *


As a vast drain to marshes and lakes, and to the destructive
overflowings of the Yellow river, it has higher claims to our admiration.
Previous to its construction, the greater part of the provinces of
Shantong and Kiang-nan, filled with lakes and marshes, from the Wan-ho
to the Yang-tse-kiang, must at all seasons have been an uninhabitable
swamp; and during the inundations of the YelloAv river, one
enormous lake. The canal being carried through their lowest part, and
communicating by numerous floodgates with the surrounding water,
has rendered them more or less subservient to the purposes osman.


During our route from Tien-sing to Qua-tchow, the banks of the
canal had exhibited no production of much interest, excepting the
peculiar aquatic vegetables afforded by the swamps to their almost
amphibious inhabitants. Besides the Nelumbium, the Trapa bicornis,
resembling in most respects the European plant of the same generic
name, was extensively cultivated, and afforded a considerable
vegetable support to the Chinese peasants. Its roots are sold in the
markets as nuts are in Europe, and Avere constantly supplied to our
tables. The root of the Scirpus tuberosus was also sold in this part
of China, and was more highly esteemed than the Trapa; but the
plant was not seen growing.


The rice fields on the banks of the canal had in some places
abounded with snakes of two species, the largest of which resembled
very closely the common snake of this country. It was found from
three to six feet in length. The smaller one was transversely striped

with black and white, and did not exceed eighteen inches in length.
Shells in considerable quantities were also found on the banks. These
were chiefly of a species of Paludina, which, Dr. Leach has observed,
is allied to P. tentaculata of Lamark, or Helix tentaculata of
Linnæus; and which he has proposed to name Paludina sinensis. For
specimens of these shells, I am indebted to their collector, Sir
George Staunton.


The latitude of Qua-tchow Dr. Lynn determined by observation to
be 39° 40' north. The same gentleman found the mean temperature
at noon, whilst he remained at this place, to be about 67*5.

  CHAPTER VI.

On the morning of the 19th of October, the Embassy entered
the Yang-tse-kiang, and took leave for some time of the route
pursued by Lord Macartney. Keeping close to the left bank,
which was covered with high rushes used for fuel, the boats
proceeded up the river with a scanty breeze, and anchored on
the morning of the tAventieth, after a progress of not more than
twenty miles, in one of the many creeks which afford shelter to
vessels navigating this river. In the evening the boats again
moved with a favourable breeze, and passed on the folloAving
morning two hills, connected by a stone arch, called
Quan-yinmun, " The Gate of the Goddess Quan-Yin." On one side was
a picturesque rock, overhung with shrubs, and crowned with trees
surrounding a pavilion; on the other was a romantic temple, built
against a perpendicular rock, called the " Iron-bound solitary
Hill."


At six o'clock the Embassy reached the suburbs of Nankin,
and anchored opposite the western gate of the city, at the
distance of two or three miles. This city, so famed for its extent,
that the Chinese declare, if two horsemen start at break of day from
any point of its walls, in opposite directions, and gallop round
them, they will not meet till sun-set, is, according to authors of
definite language, enclosed by a wall fourteen * leagues in
circumference. In earlier ages the sovereigns of China made it the capital
of the empire; but when they transferred their residence to Pekin,  
  
  
  * Memoires concernant les Chinois, torn. ix. p. 437.
<!-- Leaf 199, Page: 157 -->
they changed its name of Nankin, or the southern court, for
Kiangning-foo. Its older name is still retained in common discourse, but
its later one appears in all the public acts of the empire.


KnoAvn to Europeans by the writings of the Missionaries, and
more generally by the peculiar manufacture which bears its name, the
city of Nankin was an object of much interest to the members of
the Embassy. On approaching it, every eye endeavoured to obtain
a general view of its more elevated buildings, but could only trace
the appearance of a wall skirting a distant hill. The lateness of
the hour when the boats anchored, prevented any attempt to reach
it that evening.


Early the next morning a party entered the suburbs, and
following the direction of a paved road which led through them,
reached the desired gate, and entered, not a city thronged with
people, but a thick coppice bounding their view on all sides.
Turning to the left, they ascended a hill three or four hundred feet
in height, and overlooked an extensive space intersected with paved
roads, probably the remains of streets, now leading through
plantations of bamboo surrounding detached buildings and cultivated fields,
interspersed with hills of different elevations; the whole being
enclosed by a Avail whose limits they could not precisely define. Its form
seemed to be an irregular polygon of the computed area of thirty
miles.* Near one of its angles appeared what might be the
inhabited part of the city; but, seen at the distance of five miles, was only
marked by confused buildings surrounded by a wall, and the
celebrated porcelain pagoda which stood in its immediate vicinity.


The following morning four gentlemen reached, by a paved
road, a hill that overlooked the inhabited part of the city; and
commanded a view of a common Chinese town, surrounded by an


* " The area under our view could not be less than thirty miles, throughout diversified
with groves, houses, cultivation, and hills'; this expanse might be said to be enclosed within
the extensive wall, and formed an irregular polygon." — Ellis's Embassy, page 304.
<!-- Leaf 200, Page: 158 -->
inner wall, but exhibiting no characters of any peculiarity. They
were prevented entering it, partly by the representation of the
soldiers, but chiefly by a numberless crowd that assembled about
them. Their disappointment was the greater, as they had hoped
to reach the porcelain tower, which was not more than tAvo miles
off. Its appearance, at this distance, accorded with the description
given of it by different writers.


Of all the describers of the Porcelain Pagoda, Le Comte, copied by
Du Haide, and referred to by other authors, is the most authentic*
From his account, it appears that it is an octagonal tower two
hundred feet high, divided into nine stories, the base resting on a massy
foundation of brick-work raised ten feet from the ground, and
surrounded by a flight of twelve steps; that the lowest story, which
is the largest, has a circumference of one hundred and twenty feet,
giving to each face fifteen feet; that the other stories are of smaller
dimensions, and decrease in breadth as they ascend, but are of
equal height throughout; that the whole building is terminated by
a large pole, Avhich, rising from the centre of the eighth story,
passes through the ninth, which it exceeds thirty feet; that this is
surrounded at the distance of three or four feet by the convolutions of
an immense iron hoop, sufficiently remote to appear in the distance
like rings, diminishing as they ascend, in the manner of a cone, and
surmounted by a gilded ball; that each story has projecting roofs,
with tiles of a green colour highly varnished; that the walls are
faced with coarse porcelain slabs; that in the interior, one
hundred and ninety steps lead through its different compartments,
which are filled with gilded idols, placed in niches of the walls.
Drawings of the Pagoda, with descriptions annexed, were sold in
the suburbs of the city. These state that it was begun in the
sixteenth year of the reign of Yung-lo, of the last dynasty, and  
  
  
  * See Le Comte.
<!-- Leaf 201, Page: 159 -->
finished in the sixth year of Scun-tih, having been nineteen years in
building; and that it cost more than two millions, four hundred
thousand of taels of silver, or above eight hundred thousand pounds.
They add a legend, that the God of Thunder, in pursuing demons
to the Pagoda and there destroying them, has injured the fabric:
it has probably suffered by lightning.


In visiting the suburbs of Nankin, the Embassy found little to
interest their attention, excepting some public hot baths near the
gates of the city. To Mr. Poole, whose journal has often been of
great use to me, I am indebted for the following description:—
\"We entered a square building divided into three compartments;
the outermost lined with closets for the reception of the clothes
of the bathers who undressed in this division of the establishment.
The closets were all ticketed, perhaps Avith the names of their
proprietors, or with some recommendatory sentence: Mr. Morrison
read on one, ' The Bath of fragrant Waters.' The tAvo other
divisions of the building Avere beyond the first: the large, on the right
hand, containing three baths, about six feet in length, and
three in width and depth. At the time of our visit, they were filled
with Chinese, who, rather washing than bathing themselves, stood
upright in the water, which was only a few inches deep, and
threvv it by turns over each other's backs. There appeared no
intention of renewing the water thus become saturated with dirt, for the
use of many other Chinese who waited their turn in the outer
apartment. The steam arising from it, however fragrant to the
senses of the Chinese, was to mine really intolerable, and drove me
away before I could ascertain in what manner the baths were heated.
I just looked into the adjoining room, and found it furnished with
matted benches, and that it was used by the bathers to dry
themselves in before going to dress in the outer apartment."


Baths, it would appear, are by no means in common use amongst
the Chinese, as we met with no others in our journey through the
empire. Neither are they often mentioned in the accounts published
<!-- Leaf 202, Page: 160 -->
of China by the Jesuits. Du Haide*, indeed, says, that there is a
large establishment of them in the neighbourhood of Pekin,
resorted to by the Emperor; and Mr. Bells states generally that they
are used as a remedy; but neither writer induces the belief that
they are used as a means of cleanliness.


In the suburbs of Nankin, the cloth which bears its name was
exposed for sale. The raw yellow cotton, from which it is supposed
to be made, was in vain looked for; but the white, was seen dressing

in several places.

Amongst many other plants that grew on the walls of Nankin, the
Rosa Banksiana, Cotyledon spinosa, of Linnæus and Murray J,
Hamamelis Chinensis of Sir Joseph Banks' herbarium, and the Ficus
repens, were the most abundant. The Ficus repens almost hid the
walls by its profusion. The Hamamelis, which much resembled it in
habit, was in less quantity, but also grew in the enclosure. A
description of this plant, by Mr. Brown, accompanied by a figure, enriches
the Appendix to this Avork. The expressed juice of the Cotyledon
spinosa is said to be used by the Chinese women for dying their
hair of a black colour, and preventing baldness.


Amongst the larger plants, the Pinus Massoniana of Mr. Lambert,
and the Ginko of Kæmpfer, Qua-tchow of the Chinese, and
Salisburia adiantifolia of Smith, were found in the enclosure and
without the walls; but in no great number. The fruit of the Salisburia,
however, Avas exposed for sale in such quantities as to prove its

extensive use amongst the Chinese; but whether as a fruit, a vegetable,
or a medicine, could not be ascertained. *


The walls of Nankin, judging from a specimen now in my
possession, are built of a grey compact limestone which frequently
occurs in quarries in its neighbourhood.


Leaving this city on the twenty-fourth, the Embassy proceeded
on their route through a country becoming every day more
interesting from the approach of mountains to the banks of the river,
and arrived on the 30th at the city of Woo-hoo-shien, remarkable
for its cleanliness, the size of its shops, and for a temple lately
erected. The entrance to this was through a succession of arches,
supported on columns of solid marble highly polished. Their
vaults were richly carved into figures of the same form as those
seen in temples established for ages. The building was dedicated
to the god Fo.


On the first of November, the Embassy halted at the village of
Tung-ling-hien, and first gathered the tallow tree, Croton sebiferum of
Linnæus, Avhich here seemed to be used merely as fire-wood.


The banks of the river near the village were very high, and
exhibited a remarkable stratification. Close to the water was a bed
of pudding-stone, above this was a bed of red gravel, then a dyke
of solid rock four or five feet in thickness, and then the soil
composing the surface, also of red gravel.


On the third, the Embassy arrived at the small town of Ta-tung,
and remained there in consequence of unfavourable winds till the
seventh. During this delay, they were much annoyed by a great
number of public retiring houses, which lined the outskirts of the
town, by which the boats anchored. These, which we saw in
most cities in China, seem constructed rather for exposure than

concealment, being merely open sheds, with a rail-way over the
necessary reservoir, and seldom Avithout several occupiers.

The proprietors of these establishments derive great profit from
the sale of their contents, called by them ta-few, which they use
extensively as a manure. It is prepared in several ways.
Sometimes it is mixed with a large quantity of mould, and made into
cakes. In forming these, a layer of a few inches in thickness is
spread out in the open air on an even surface, and, when dry, is
divided into pieces of the requisite dimensions, generally about a
foot square. These, which it is asserted not only lose the odour
of their principal ingredient, but acquire that of the violet, are
conveyed all over the empire, and find a ready sale. Before
being used, they are dissolved in large quantities of Avater, or broken
into small pieces, and are then applied to the land. When, however,
the ta-few is to be employed near the place in which it is accumulated,
a different mode of preparing it is pursued and generally preferred.
In pits lined with plaster, it is diluted Avith a large proportion of
water, and suffered to remain several days before it is used. It

is then either poured into small channels that traverse the fields
in every direction, or applied directly to the roots of the plants, or
scattered over them with a small bucket. For its more convenient
distribution, the peasantry have usually a tub for its reception sunk
in the centre of their small gardens, in the neighbourhood of their
cottages. To the use of this manure is in a good measure to be
attributed the surprising productiveness of small plots of ground
about Chinese huts, especially in their favourite vegetable the
Petsai. It is not, however, confined to this plant, but largely
used in their cotton fields, to young plants of which it is applied
in considerable quantities. That it is used also in their
ricegrounds, and in all cases in which manure is required, there can
be little doubt.  
  
  
  A writer* has observed respecting the latter mode of preparing  
  
  
  * Memoires concernant les Chinois, torn. ii. p. 613.
<!-- Leaf 205, Page: 163 -->
the ta-few, that as it is the most offensive, we are justified in
supposing that it is the most efficacious; and adds generally, with
regard to the kind of manure, that it is demonstrated by
experience that the ta-few is the most useful and the most efficacious
of all manure, especially upon wet and greasy lands. Its extensive
use by the Chinese may perhaps be the consequence of much fewer
animals being used in the cultivation of the lands in China than in
other countries, and of the poorer class living not more on corn than
on vegetables; for the cultivators of these are generally small
cottagers, who are obliged to employ the means most within reach for
raising their crops.


In the village of Ta-tung, many workmen were employed in
freeing the white cotton of its seed. The mill used for this purpose
was very simple in its construction, and resembled in most respects
that employed in the same operation in the East Iudies, which has
been described and figured by Dr. Buchanan. * It consisted of two
wooden cylinders, placed horizontally one above the other, on a
stand a few feet from the ground. The cylinders, very nearly
touching, Avere put in motion by a wheel acted upon by the foot.
The cotton, being brought to one side of the crevice, intervening
between them during their revolution, Avas turned over to the
opposite, whilst the seeds, being too large to enter, fell at the feet
of the Avorkmen. The instrument used in freeing it from knots and
dirt, is equally simple, and is the same as that used, I believe, in most
countries for the same or a similar purpose. It is a very elastic bow
with a tight string. In using it, the carder places it in a heap of the
material, and, having pulled down the string with some force, he
suddenly allows the bow to recoil: the vibration of the string scatters

the cotton about, and separates it into fibres freed from all knots
and impurities.*


The country about Ta-tung was hilly and picturesque, and
productive in rare plants. It was here that some of the trees and
shrubs, peculiar to China, were first met with. A small plantation
of tea, from its extent, seeming rather to be cultivated for
experiment than for the purpose of manufacturing, was seen on
the side of a hill. It was of the large-leaved variety.


The plants most interesting to the finders, were several species
of oak, occurring in large plantations. This tree, equally prized
and used in China as in other countries, has been described and
eulogised in the ancient books of the empire, and is designated
by the appellation of the Tree of Inheritance, f The same works
assert, that oaks, upwards of a hundred feet in height and
twentyfour in circumference, are frequent in China; and that others have
existed whose foliage covered an acre of ground. That for building,
dyeing, and fuel, they are in general use. That their various parts
used in medicine in other countries, are employed with similar views
in China. That acorns are in some provinces an efficient article of
food; that some are esculent without preparation; that others must
be deprived of their crudeness, after being denuded of their husks,
by grinding them in a mill, and subsequent immersion in water for
several days; and that both afford a farinaceous paste, which, mixed
with the flour or corn, or by itself, is made into cakes.


Such is the history of the Oak given by those who had the
best means of arriving at information about it. I cannot learn that
the gentlemen who visited the plantations of the tree near Ta-tung
met with any circumstances either confirming or contradicting it.

  OAKS. m

Of the oaks seen at this place, many were remarkable for their
beauty, few for their size. The largest seen did not exceed the
height of fifty feet. They seemed to be used chiefly as pollards;
considerable quantities of their branches being accumulated for
firewood, or perhaps for charring.


One of the largest and most interesting of these trees, which
I have called Quercus densifolia, was an evergreen, closely allied to
the Quercus glabra of Thunberg, and resembled a laurel in the
shining green of its foliage. It bore its branches and leaves in a
thick head, crowning a naked and straight stem. Its fruit grew in
long upright spikes, terminating the branches. Another species,
Quercus Chinensis *, growing to the height of fifty feet, bore them in
long pendulous spikes. Of this I have fortunately preserved a good
specimen, through Sir George Staunton, and have given the
accompanying figure. The leaves of some were distinguished by red
prominent veins on the under surface; others by their size, and some
by the hair, like processes, which fringed their margin. Five distinct
species were found in a short walk.


Growing with the oaks, were some dwarf chesnuts; the fruit of
which was exposed for sale at the village, and were not larger than
the common bon-nut of this country.


From the shops of the same place I received several species of
fern, which are used as vegetables, infused as tea and administered
as medicine. The most general was the Pteris piloselloides. Ginger
was also much grown among the hills, and sold in the shops in a
green state as a common vegetable.


The country in the vicinity of Ta-tung owed its chief interest to
its plants. The people continued to display the same curiosity in
observing the strangers as elsewhere, but exhibited few traits of
character worth recording. The only interesting circumstance that  
  
  
  * See Appendix.
<!-- Leaf 210, Page: 166 -->
seems to have been observed is told by Mr. Morrison, who, in one
of his Avalks, fell in with a family of four generations, amounting to
about twenty persons, in the same house. At the feet of the
Patriarch, who was only seventy years of age, stood his great
grandchild, whilst at one end of the room his son Avas working at his
father's coffin. The old man, on being asked why he now prepared
his coffin? ansAvered, that he felt his health declining, and wished
to have a resting-place prepared for him after death. When asked
if the sight of the coffin did not excite mournful ideas, he replied,
\"No." A mandarin, who was by, remarked, " Flis mouth says
no, but it does not speak the language of his heart."


The Embassy left the village of Ta-tung on the morning of the
seventh, and, continuing their route, arrived on the eleventh at the
village of Hwa-yuen-chin, no otherwise remarkable than as being the
scene of a fatal accident to one of the Embassy. William Millidge,
one of the guard attached to Mr. Morrison's boat, in passing along
its gang-way, fell into the water, and, in spite of every exertion
made to save him, was swept under the boat by the current and was
drowned. The Legate halted the boats till his remains were interred,
and a tomb-stone placed at the head of his grave Avith the
following inscription in Chinese characters :—" The Tomb of Millidge,
one of the Body Guard of the British Ambassador, November 12th,
1816."


The boats having quitted Hwa-yuen-chin immediately after the
interment of the body, passed in the afternoon of the tAvelfth a
conical rock, two hundred feet in height, called Seaou-koo-shan,
or the little orphan hill, rising in the middle of the river. This
rock is composed of pudding-stone, and resembles in most respects
the Kin-shan.


Early on the 13th, the Embassy reached the borders of the
province of Kiang-si, and entered it on the following morning.

By noon the next day, the Embassy quitted the Yang-tse-kiang,
whose broad expanse was seen far away to the westward, and
entered the Po-yang lake.
<!-- Leaf 211 -->
  
  TA-KOO-TANG. J 57


The entrance to this lake was grand, from the immense chain of
mountains forming its western boundary, the most conspicuous of
which was distinguished by its five peaks. On entering the lake, the
Embassy passed the Ta-koo-shan, or great orphan rock, less
interesting in all its characters than the smaller one of the same name.


On the 14th, the boats reached the small town of Ta-koo-tang,
and Avere detained there by boisterous weather till the sixteenth.
During this delay, parties visited the neighbouring country, and
found it abounding in several plantations of oaks and firs; to
which were now added occasional plants of the Pinus lanceolatus,
brought to Europe by the former Embassy. A very distinct new
genus also rewarded the pursuits of my friends, with a description
of which Mr. Brown has enriched this work, and called Abelia
Chinensis. This plant, which was notmet with after leaving the
Po-yang lake, is a straggling shrub with pendant branches. Its
flowers Avere, for the most part, faded when it was found; but its
permanent pink calyces, clustered into thick heads, gave it a beautiful
appearance. The tallow-tree also greAv here in abundance, and was
a most magnificent plant. I shall have occasion to describe it
elsewhere.


Leaving Ta-koo-tang on the morning of the 16th, the Embassy
arrived the same day at the city of Nan-kang-foo, situated at the
base of a lofty mountain forming part of an extensive ridge. Snow
covered the summit of the mountain, which, according to the Chinese,
would remain till the fourth moon of the ensuing season, but melted
before a bright sun the next day.


The city of Nan-kang-foo scarcely repaid those who visited it the
trouble of the walk. The appearance of the walls, which had lately
been repaired, had promised a populous and thriving city; and such
it had been in former ages; but it now contained very few houses,
compared with its extent; and was filled with beggars. A number of
stone archAvays still remain, that appear formerly to have been
superior specimens of their style of architecture : men, quadrupeds, and
birds, are sculptured upon them in relief: they bear the dates of

jgg NAN-KANG-FOO.

Han-lish and Kean-tsing, of the last dynasty. There are two temples
in the city dedicated to Confucius, and a Woo-meaou, or temple,
dedicated to the military demi-god of China.


The neighbourhood of Nan-kang-foo contains some of the most
romantic scenery seen by the Embassy in China. Of this the founder
of the Pih-luh-tung-shoo-yuen, or " College of the white stag valley,"
had taken the fullest advantage, and built it at the farther end of a
deep ravine shaded by trees, and watered by a beautiful spring. This
temple is famous in China, as having been anciently a national seminary
in Avhich Choo-foo-tze, the favourite commentator of Confucius, taught
about six hundred years ago. Those who were conversant in Chinese
literature took the first opportunity of visiting it, in the hope of
meeting with some books containing the doctrines of the sage. On reaching
the temple, they found no difficulty in persuading the priests, after
previously wiping their face and hands with a wet towel, to lead them
to a well-stored library; but on this occasion could not bribe the
priests to dispose of any of the sacred volumes. The valley in which
the temple stands, derives its name from a white stag; the image of
which is placed in an arched recess of the temple behind a statue of
Choo-foo-tze. This animal, according to the chronicles of the place,
was employed by the sage as his caterer at the market of
Nan-gangfoo, at the distance of seven miles; money and a note having been
attached to his horns, he was despatched to the city, and always
returned with the Avished-for supplies.


The neighbourhood of Nan-kang-foo being rocky, afforded fewer
species of trees and flowering plants than many other parts of the
country through which we had passed; but abounded in rare and
undescribed ferns and mosses. Amongst many other ferns, I have it
now in my power to name the following only: Adiantumfiabellulatum,
Asplenium lanceum, Aspidium varium, Blechnum Orientate, a species
of Davallia very closely allied to Davallia Canariensis, a species of
Hydroglossum very common in the south of China, Polypodium lineare,
Pteris semipinnata, Pteris biaurita, and another species of Pteris,
between Pteris caudata and Pteris aquilina, and a new species of
<!-- Leaf 213, Page: 169 -->
Woodwardia allied to Woodwardia Japonica, but differing from it, in having
acute lobes.


An Ilex was brought me, which I have been unable to distinguish
from the Ilex aquifolium of this country. A species, I believe, of
mulberry, with fruit of the colour and general appearance of a strawberry,
but clustered around the branches, was also gathered in this part of our
route.


Leaving Nan-kang-foo on the 20th, the Embassy arrived the same
day at Woo-ching-chin, situated, according to Mr. Morrison, on the
left bank of the Tan-ho, which flows by the capital of Kiang-si, and
enters the Po-yang lake. Woo-ching-chin is a great depot for the
commodities of various provinces, and is distinguished by its
numerous Kwung-kwan, or halls of merchants. At Woo-ching-chin, the
boats quitted the Po-yang lake, and, proceeding on their route,
reached Nan-chang-foo on the twenty-third.


My readers may, in this part of my work, complain of the rapid
manner in Avhich I have hurried them over upwards of two hundred
miles of one of the finest rivers of China, and across one of its largest
lakes. I have done so, because I believed that a short and general
description, accompanied by a map of our route, rendered as expressive
as circumstances will admit, would be more interesting than a
detailed account of the different towns and temples visited on their
banks. Every thing artificial in China has nearly the same characters
in every proArince. A person who has seen one of its cities has in a
sood measure seen them all. The materials of which they are formed
differ as their situation affords clay or stone, but their style of building
is always the same. Such also is the case with their pagodas: they
differ in height, and the number of their stages; but a pagoda at Pekin,
at Nankin, or at Canton, would each afford nearly the same description.
The features of the country, however, are infinitely varied. China,
from the great extent of latitude contained in its boundaries, and from
its extensive plains and lofty mountains, partakes of the advantages
and defects of many climates. The weather and the season during the
passage of the Embassy, prevented them from forming a correctjudgz
<!-- Leaf 214, Page: 170 -->
ment in what degree the Yang-tse-kiang partakes of either. Enough,
however, was observed to vindicate its claim to its high-sounding
appellations: Yang-tse-kiang, " Son of the Sea;" Ta-kiang, " Great River;"
Kiang, " The River;" the pre-eminent titles given to it by the
Chinese: its great depth has occasioned the saying, that " as the
ocean is boundless, so is the Yang-tse-kiang fathomless." There can
be little doubt, indeed, that for the extent of country Avhich it
traverses, and the number of streams by which it is fed, it may be
considered one of the finest rivers of the Old World. The concurring
testimony of the Chinese and the charts of the Missionaries, show that
it flows from west to east, in a devious course, through the whole
breadth of China. Of its numerous tributary streams and lakes, the
reader may form some comprehension by examining the more
general map which accompanies this work, bearing in mind that its scale
is necessarily so small as to exclude the insertion of many. To have
an accurate conception on this point, he must consult the great chart
of the Missionaries.


I have scarcely an observation to make on the Po-yang lake. The
Embassy entered it with the expectation of seeing an expanse
of water thirty French leagues in circumference, but passed rapidly
along its western shore without gaining a single view of any very great
extent. Their disappointment was perhaps the consequence of the
haziness of the weather, and the many islands which cover it. Ranges
of high mountains, Avhich chiefly skirt its western shore, supply, no
doubt, many of the rivers which feed it. The same mountains must
often give rise to sudden gusts of wind, and may sometimes occasion
the hurricanes which, the Missionaries declare, often sweep the
surface of the lake.


The general cultivation on the Yang-tse-kiang and Po-yang lake
was in rice, wherever the nature of the land allowed it. The Arum
esculentum, petsai, and ground-nut, Arachis hypogœa, were also
exceedingly abundant, and afforded a vast quantity of vegetable food.
Deer were seen, and pheasants, partridges somewhat resembling
grouse, snipes and wild fowl were common in the markets; geese
<!-- Leaf 215, Page: 171 -->
and ducks occurred in large flocks on the river and lake, and were so
tame that they could be approached within a few yards. A
woodcock was pursued by a gentleman at Qua-chow. Both the
Yang-tsekiang and Po-yang-ho are profusely productive in excellent fish.
Carp and mullet abounded in the markets of all the towns visited on
their banks by the Embassy. A few porpoises were observed in the
river, and were called river-pigs by the Chinese.


The scenery of the Yang-tse-kiang and Po-yang-ho combined that
of every river and lake enclosed in a mountainous and verdant
country, and a peculiarity arising from numerous islands, often rising
abruptly tAvo or three hundred feet above their surface, covered
with the grotesque buildings of the Chinese, surrounded by groves
of bamboo and pine. They, for the most part, exhibited the same
characters as the Kin-shan, or Golden Hill, and like it verify the
accuracy of many Chinese landscapes.


The Pinus Massoniana, and several species of oak, mingled
occasionally with the tallow and camphor trees, were the chief
ornaments of the shores of that part of the Yang-tse-kiang and Po-yang
lake gone over by the Embassy. The Pine was often in considerable
groves, and appeared to grow at a great elevation.


A bluish grey compact lime-stone was found amongst the debris
of the shores of the Yang-tse-kiang, and in quarries in the
neighbourhood of Nankin. The islands which were examined consisted of
an agglomerate, composed of round and angular fragments of quartz,
of lime-stone, and of felspar porphyry, either united by a very thin
argillaceous cement, or imbedded in sand-stone. The banks of the
river sometimes presented a similar formation. The Leu-shan
mountains, near the junction of the Yang-tse-kiang with the Po-yang
lake, were composed of small-grained granite, containing
milkwhite felspar, smoke grey quartz, and greyish black mica; and ofa
micaceous schistus with scarcely any quartz. Very large perfect
crystals of felspar were also brought to me from the same place: many
of them were three or four inches in their largest diameter, and

were often conjoined with masses of light grey mica, of nearly equal
dimensions.


The map which introduces this chapter will convey to the reader
some idea of that part of the Yang-tse-kiang gone over by the
Embassy, and of the extent and form of the Po-yang lake as laid down
by the Missionaries. I have marked on it the height of the
barometer, thermometer, and hygrometer, at noon every day during our
passage, and the productions of the country as far as I could obtain
accurate information respecting them.


The barometer varied very little during our route from
Quachow to Nan-chang-foo, but the hygrometer rose or fell with
every change of the wind. The thermometer often fell below 50°
of Fahrenheit. The prevailing wind was north-easterly, which
depressed the hygrometer, whilst southerly winds raised it; an
effect contrary to what I had observed in the Yellow sea. This
difference of result is obviously explained by the consideration, that
in the Yellow sea the north-easterly wind was from the land, and
therefore a dry wind, and on the Yang-tse-kiang, a sea wind, and
therefore a moist wind, and vice versa with respect to the southerly
winds. These circumstances are further conclusive of the delicacy
of Leslie's hygrometer as a meteorological instrument. For the
details of the experiments, I refer my reader to the Appendix.
<!-- Leaf 217, Page: 173 -->
  
  CHAPTER VII.

At Nan-chang-foo, where the Embassy re-entered upon the route
pursued by Lord Macartney, I went abroad for the first time after
my illness, and had regained sufficient power of observation to
be interested in the scenery and productions of the country through
which we were passing. For the conclusion of this work, I depend
chiefly on my own journal.


The city of Nan-chang-foo is famous for shops of porcelain, and
gave us many opportunities of examining splendid vases formed of
the finest quality of this celebrated ware. Many of these were four feet
high and two in their largest circumference, of various colours, and
covered with an immense number of raised figures of plants well
executed. This imitation of sculpture was also practised on smaller
pieces, as cups, basins, and especially snuff-bottles. On one of these,
whose surface could not be more than six inches square, the
forms of a crowd of Chinese executed with precision and taste,
were beautifully grouped. I have repeatedly seen on articles of
this kind a display of skill and accuracy in the delineation of the
human form for which it is not usual to give the Chinese credit.
The porcelain most valued by the Chinese was not in our eyes the
most beautiful; being covered Avith lines intersecting each other
in all directions, occasioning a cracked appearance on its surface.
This is done perhaps to give it an appearance of antiquity, as
antique porcelain is in the highest degree valued in China.*


* The Missionaries give a different account of the Porcelaine Craquelee: — L'eau qui
se glace en hiver, dans certains vases, a exactement la forme de Ja porcelaine
craquelee. II est tout simple que, voyant la forme d'un vase en eau glacee de cette
<!-- Leaf 218, Page: 174 -->

Some of the representations on the cups and other vessels sold in
Nang-chang-foo, gave us the lowest opinion of Chinese sentiments
of decency. Although infinitely too gross to admit any description,
they were not only exposed in the most open manner on the
shelves of the shops, but were handed about by the salesmen as
objects of peculiar interest.


The shops in which the porcelain was sold were capacious, and
very neatly fitted up. Indeed I scarcely recollect seeing any
spectacle in China that gratified me more than a first-rate porcelain
warehouse. The various articles of all forms, dimensions, and
colours, were so arranged as to produce the best effect. Our
purchases were inconsiderable, in consequence of the difficulty of
transporting such brittle goods, and of the usual exactions of the
soldiers. The prices asked for the large vases Avere from fifty to
eighty Spanish dollars.


A fire broke out in the suburbs whilst we remained at this city;
which, although it raged at first with great violence, in the midst of
houses, built chiefly of wood, was speedily extinguished. Two engines,
brought over as a present to the Emperor, were offered by His
Excellency to the legate on the occasion, but were refused. Our senses,
indeed, soon informed us that they were not required. Although our
boats were anchored on the opposite side of the river, we could
distinctly see water pouring in streams upon the flames; but had no
opportunity of seeing the machines which raised it.


Leaving Nan-chang-foo on the 27th, the Embassy re-commenced
their route, and entered a country highly ornamented with useful
and beautiful plants. Of these the species of Camellia, which
produces much of the oil consumed by the Chinese, was the most
remarkable. Its figure given in the next page, will convey a correct
notion of its appearance to the general reader. This beautiful shrub,
which I have called Camellia oleifera, is the Tcha-Yeou of the Chinese;

facon singuliere, on y ait donne quelque attention, et qu'on en ait fait usage
ensuite pour imaginer une nouvelle facon de porcelaine.

<!-- Leaf 221, Page: 175 -->
Avhich might be translated, " the oil-bearing tea plant;" a very
expressive name, as the plant, in general appearance, closely resembles the
tea, and yields oil. It was brought into this country by the former
Embassy, and considered as the Camellia sesanqua of authors, from
which, however, I apprehend it is very distinct.* We sometimes
found it of the magnitude of a moderate sized cherry-tree, and always
that of a large shrub, from six to eight feet in height, and bearing a
profusion of large single Avhite blossoms. This circumstance gave
an interesting and novel character to the places which it covered.
They often looked in the distance, as if lightly clothed with snow;
but on a nearer view, exhibited one immense garden.


The Camellia oleifera seems to flourish best in a red sandy soil,
on which few other plants will grow. The Chinese cultivate it in
large plantations, and procure from its seed a pure esculent oil by
a very easy process. The seeds are first reduced to a coarse powder
by one of several methods. Sometimes they are pounded in a large
mortar, by a weight at the end of a lever, acted upon by the cogs of
a water-wheel. At others, they are crushed by a horizontal wheel,
having small perpendicular wheels, shod with iron, fixed to its
circumference, and acting in a groove lined with the same metal.  
  
  
  * See Appendix.

<!-- Leaf 222, Page: 176 -->

When sufficiently ground, they are put into bags and boiled,
or rather stewed, a short time, in a vessel containing a small
quantity of water; and are then transferred to a press, where
they yield the oil. This press is of very rude construction. It
consists of the hollowed trunk of a tree open at one end, and
having two square holes mortised in its' sides, opposite each other.
It is so supported that the open end is higher than the other. When
the oil is to be expressed, one of the bags is put into the trunk, and
pushed back to its depressed end. Semicircular pieces of wood are
then introduced through the mortices on each side, and meeting, form
a circle, which is equal to the circumference of the hollow. Several
of these are successively introduced, and fill up the interval between
the bag and the mortices, and some space beyond, as shown in the
figure. They are then driven back with great force upon the seed, by
the means of bars and wedges of wood forced in by an immense
hammer in the form of a battering ram. The oil runs from the press
through a small opening in its depressed end.
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P222_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 223, Page: 177 -->

The tree producing tallow, Croton sebiferum of Linnæus, was one of
the largest, the most beautiful, and the most widely diffused, of the
plants found by us in China. We first met with it a few miles south of
Nankin, and continued to remark it, in greater or less abundance, till
our arrival at Canton.* We often saw it, imitating the oak in the
height of its stem and the spread of its branches. Its foliage has the
green and lustre of the laurel. Its small flowers, of a yellow colour,
are borne at the ends of its terminal branches. Clusters of dark
coloured seed vessels succeed them in autumn; and, when matured,
burst asunder and disclose seeds of a delicate whiteness.


The fruit of the talloAV tree goes through nearly the same process in
yielding its extract as the seed of the oil plant. The machine in
Avhich it Avas seen to be bruised, differed indeed from those employed
for pounding the seed of the Camellia; but was, no doubt, often used
for both purposes. It Avas ground by a Avheel moved backwards and
forwards in a trunk of a tree, shaped like a canoe, lined with iron, and
fixed in the ground. To the axis of the wheel was fixed a long pole,
laden with a heavy weight, and suspended from a beam, in the way
illustrated by the wood engraving.


* The tallow tree has many names in China; amongst others, Ya-Rieou, because
crows are fond of its fruit; Ya being the character which signifies a crow; the other

<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P223_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 224, Page: 178 -->

The seed, after being pounded, was formed into a thick mass, by
heating it with a small quantity of water in a large iron vessel. It was
then put hot into a case formed to receive it. This consisted of four
or five broad iron hoops, piled one over the other, and lined with
straw. The seed was pressed down with the feet, as close as possible,
till it filled the case, which was then transferred to the press.


Pressure, however, is not the only, or, perhaps, the most common
method of obtaining the tallow; for it is sometimes procured by boiling
the bruised seed in water, and collecting the oily matter which floats on
its surface. This tallow, Avhich has all the sensible properties of that
from the animal kingdom, is used in the manufacture of candles. Du
Haide informs us, that every ten pounds is mixed with three of some
vegetable oil, and a sufficient quantity of wax to give it
consistence. The candles also receive additional support from a coating of
wax. They burn with great flame, emit much smoke, and quickly
consume.


In giving some account of the magnificent plants which often
adorned the banks of the river, during our progress through the
southern provinces of China, I must not omit to mention the
camphor tree, Laurus camphora, growing to the size of our largest
elms or oaks, in the provinces of Kiang-si and Canton. The Chinese
affirm that it sometimes attains the height of more than three
hundred feet, and a circumference greater than can be embraced by the
extended arms of twenty men.* We saw no instance of its
magnitude that at all justified this description. The largest that was
measured by the persons of the Embassy was twenty feet in
circumference, and about fifty feet high, and was chiefly remarkable for the
size of its branches; many of them being nine feet in circumference.  
  
  
  The camphor obtained from this tree is less valued by the Chinese

character, Rieou, signifies a mortar for separating the husk from rice, and enters into its
name, because when the tree grows old, its root decays within, and becomes hollowed in
the form ofa mortar.—Du Haide, torn. iii. p. 504.  
  
  
  * Lettres Edifiantes, tome xxii. p. 192.
<!-- Leaf 225, Page: 179 -->
than that which they procure from Borneo. This preference
probably depends on the adulteration of the article by the Chinese
manufacturer, since the mode of refining it is well known. The process
pursued in many respects resembles that used in Japan*, and has
been described by the Pere d'Entrecolles.f Fresh gathered branches
of the tree having been steeped for two or three days in water, are
then boiled in a proper vessel, being the whole time continually stirred
about with a stick, till the gum begins to adhere to it in the form of a
white jelly. The fluid is then poured off into a glazed vessel, and after
being at rest for some hours, is found concreted. The crude
camphor is then purified in the following manner. A quantity of the
finely powdered materials of some old wall, built of earth, is put
as a first layer at the bottom of a copper basin; on this is placed a
layer of camphor, and then another of earth, and so on till the vessel
is nearly filled; the series being terminated with a layer of earth.
Over this is laid a covering of the leaves of the plant Po-ho, perhaps
a species of Mentha. A second basin is now inverted over the first,
and luted on. The whole, thus prepared, is put over a regulated fire,
and submitted to its action for a certain length of time; it is then
removed and suffered to cool. The camphor is found to have
sublimed, and to be attached to the upper basin. It is further
refined by repetitions of the same process.


Besides the Laurus camphora, I found another species of laurel
highly impregnated with the pungency and flavour of the gum, and
which is probably used by the Chinese for its extraction. It so nearly
resembled its congener Avhen growing, as to require a close
examination to distinguish. It is, however, distinctly separated by the form
of its leaves and the distribution of their nerves. The camphor tree is

one of the principal timber trees of China, being used in building,
and in the fabrication of articles of furniture.


A species of Ficus*, called Yung-shoo by the Chinese, much
resembling the banyan in habit, grew very commonly in sandy soil
on the banks of rivers from the Po-yang lake to the mountain of
Mei-ling. Its form gave a singularly grotesque character to the
scenery. Its trunk is made up of a series of small stems always
close together. Its branches are wide and straggling, but scarcely
overshadow its arching roots rising above the soil and covering a
considerable space of ground.


But although the land on both sides the river was favourable to the
growth of many beautiful and useful plants, it was seldom very
productive in any of those which afford the essential vegetable support
of mankind. Between the Po-yang lake and the Mei-ling mountain,
the quantity of land cultivated in corn bore no proportion to that
which was entirely barren or covered with plantations of Camellia.


We proceeded on our route up the Kan-Keang, whose stream was
clear as crystal, without meeting with any circumstance worth
noticing till the 6th of December. On that day the boatmen sent
a petition to the Ambassador, requesting a pecuniary gratuity to
enable them to perform the usual rites before passing the She-pa-tan
or eighteen cataracts, an appellation little applicable to what are
only rocky shoals in the bed of the river. We had great
difficulty indeed, but little danger in passing them, not even the most
perilous, called Tien-san-tan, or the pillars of heaven.


The rocks forming the shoals, when first met with, were of granite,
and afterwards of a dark-coloured compact schistus much resembling
the kill as of Cornwall. The river seemed to have worn away the
superincumbent formation of sandstone, which narrowed the channel
of the river into a mere ravine, and to have been checked in itsde
* It is very closely allied in the outline of its leaves to Ficus benjamina of Wildenow,
but differs from it in a less equal distribution oftheir nerves, and in wanting the white

grading process by the harder rocks. The soil on the surface in this
part of our route was generally of a dark red, and seemed peculiarly
favourable to the growth of pines. Large plantations of these covered
the hills in the neighbourhood of See-chou, where we anchored on
the 8th of December.


The Pinus Massoniana of Mr. Lambert still continued to be the most
general species of fir, but was occasionally mingled with the Pinus
lanceolata of the same author. We usually found this last tree a young
and flourishing plant, seldom more than eight or ten feet high, rarely
reaching to tAventy or thirty. Here also we gathered the tea-plant,
apparently in its native habitat, near no plantation. It was a small
shrub of what has commonly been considered the green variety.
The Dryandra cor data of Thunberg, Tong-choo of the Chinese, grew
in the same place. From the seeds of this plant the Chinese extract
an oil which they use as a varnish for their boats and coarser articles of
furniture. They often mix it with the more valuable varnish obtained
from a species of Rhus, and sell the compound as the superior article.
I did not see the true varnish tree growing, but judging from
specimens brought to me by my friends, have little doubt of its
being an undescribed species of Rhus, and not the Rhus vernix.
In the remainder of our route through the province of Kiang-si, the
most striking productions of the soil were those which I have already
described; but every day brought me some new and very rare
species of smaller plants. Of these, a new species of Eugenia,
which as it is perhaps the smallest of its genus, has been named
Eugenia microphylla, covered the declivities of almost every hill in
the province of Kiang-si. It is a very elegant plant, strongly
resembling a myrtle, and grows to the height of one or two feet.* It
bears thick terminal clusters of dark purple berries, which were eaten
by our Chinese attendants.


On the 18th the Embassy reached the city of Nan-gan-foo,
situated at the northern base of the Mei-ling mountain. This city differed  
  
  
  * See Appendix.
<!-- Leaf 228, Page: 182 -->
in no respect from many others which we had visited. Its
environs were picturesque from the mountain ranges, which formed
a magnificent amphitheatre around them. These were too distant
to be approached in any of our limited excursions. Our curiosity was
therefore obliged to rest satisfied till we crossed the Mei-ling
mountain, which formed the centre of a ridge that swept from east to west,
bounding and separating the provinces of Kiang-si and Canton.


The rocks in the neighbourhood of the city were nearly
horizontally stratified, and consisted of shistus of a very close texture, and
dark gray colour. Similar rocks had formed the immediate banks of
the river for several days before our arrival. The hills were rich in
rare and beautiful plants, of which I can only name the Eurya
Japonica* of Thunberg, which covered them in the greatest profusion.


Much of the cultivation about Nan-gan-foo was in the
groundnut Arachis hypogœa. This plant, so remarkable for its wide
geographical distributions, is cultivated by the Chinese for the oil extracted
from its seeds, and for the nourishment they afford to the common
people as a fruit and a vegetable. We had been supplied with them
in all parts of our route, but first met with the plant cultivated in
fields on the banks of the Yang-tse-kiang, and continued to observe
it through the whole province of Kiang-si and of Canton. Before
the seeds, which ripen under ground, are collected, the stems of the
plant are cut by a hoe close to the earth. The seeds are then taken
up and put into a large sieve, suspended between three poles set up
in a triangle : one man feeds the sieve, whilst another shakes it, and
separates the dirt. If! what manner the oil is procured from the
seeds we had no opportunity of learning. They are roasted before  
  
  
  * See Appendix.


f Of this plant, which was found cultivated along the banks of the Congo as far as
they were examined by Capt. Tuckey, Mr. Brown has observed, " There is nothing very
improbable in the supposition of Arachis hypogœa being indigenous to Asia, Africa, and
even Armenia; but if it be considered as belonging to one of those continents only, it is
more likely to have been brought from China through India to Africa, than to have been
carried in the opposite direction."—Botanical Appendix of Capt. Tuckey's Journal of the
Expedition to explore the Congo.
<!-- Leaf 229, Page: 183 -->
they are eaten as fruit. A Canton linguist Who attended the
Embassy, took some pains to teach me their mode of growth, and seemed
quite aware that they were not the roots of the plant, but had been
part of the floAver. The Arachis hypogœa bears in China from two
to four seeds in each capsule.


We quitted our boats at Nan-gan-foo for a short land journey
across the Mei-ling mountain, computed to be a thousand feet above
the level of the plain whence we ascended.


Chairs and horses being provided for our conveyance, we set out
early on the morning of the 20th. Having passed through a cultivated
flat of some extent, we began about an hour after leaving the city, to
ascend the acclivity of the mountain. It soon became very steep, but
was rendered practicable by a paved road that wound over it, and
which in the most difficult part was formed into broad and gentle steps.
Groves of fir trees skirted our way, forming in some places vistas,
through which we overlooked the surrounding country: a valley of
great extent was bounded by lofty mountains. The scene derived its
chief interest from its moving objects. Looking back on the road
we had passed, we saw a long train of chairs, horsemen, and porters,
winding up the steep. Forwards the road narrowed in a defile,
leading through the mountain, and near its termination became so
precipitous as to oblige the horsemen to dismount. Our steeds were
small, but spirited and powerful, and climbed with great perse\Terance
and effect. The bearers of the sedans moved with a quickness and
apparent ease which surprised me. Four carried each of the chairs
of the principal mandarins who attended us, and moved in
measured but quick time, in an oblique direction, avoiding the direct
steepness of the path. The soldiers who accompanied us were
equally active. Many of them were fine athletic men, and would
in themselves have induced me to think well of the physical
efficiency of the military in China. One attended each of the
gentlemen who Avere on horseback, and kept up with him at whatever
pace he rode, without giving any signs of fatigue.  
  
  
  In our way we overtook a herd of porters transporting the presents
<!-- Leaf 230, Page: 184 -->
Avhich had been intended for the Emperor, and were highly amused
at their ridiculous care of two fire engines, which they supported
by the assistance of poles a few inches from the ground. When,
by any chance, the wheels of these machines, sanctified by their first
destination, touched the earth, a loud shout from the bearers testified
their alarm lest they should have been injured by the shock.


Arrived on the summit, we entered a narrow pass cut through the
solid rock, a work only to be accomplished at the expense of great
time and difficulty. The rock is argillaceous sandstone of a compact
structure. The narrowest part of the ridge had probably been chosen
to cut through, as it did not appear to be more than forty or fifty
feet in length, and might be as many in height, and half' as many in
width.


The pass was formed during the dynasty Tang, about a thousand
years ago, by a private individual. An arched gateway stands in
the centre, marking the boundary between the provinces of Kiang-si
and Quang-tong. Mr. Morrison decyphered several inscriptions cut
on the sides of the rock. One of these Teen-le-jin-tsing, " Heavenly
principles and humane feelings," probably applied to the man Avho
formed the pass, and was engraved in very large characters. Near
the entrance to the pass on the Canton side, we saw a species of
Prunus in full flower, called by the Chinese Mei-h\va-shoo, " Mei
flower-tree." Hence the name of the mountain, Mei-ling, signifying
the mountain of the mey-flower.


The top of the mountain is distinctly and horizontally stratified,
but is divided into stair-like masses. The sandstone is small grained;
in its fresh fracture has almost the dark gray colour of clay slate,
but where it is exposed to weather is reddish.


We descended by a very steep declivity on she southern side of the
mountain, into an extensive plain. The scene was Avild and strange.
Innumerable " rocks piled on rocks as if by magic spell," of forms too
fantastic for language to paint, covered its surface and every Avhere
bounded the view. Immense square blocks, seemingly piled on each
other by art and rising to a great height, gave to some a castellated, to

others a pyramidal form. Worn by the action of the elements, their
surface had become vesicular, and their angles, from the same cause,
often represented the most grotesque profile. They presented
forms, indeed, so at variance with any which I had ever before seen,
that I could not help suspecting that their composition would be
found equally peculiar. But they proved, on examination, to be a
very fine granular, approaching to compact limestone. Of their
internal colour, for they were covered externally with lichens, I can
make no positive mention, as I have not recovered any of the
specimens to which I have referred for this character in my journal; but
judging from others collected in their neighbourhood, and probably of
the same formation, I have little doubt that it is reddish gray.
The distinct blocks of which they were composed seemed to be the
remains of a horizontal stratification.


The loAver plate of the geological views in China is given rather
Avith a view to assist the description, than as approaching to an
accurate representation of these rocks: it would have been hopeless
to have attempted an imitation of their varied shapes. These rocks
are quarried for limestone. Kilns for burning it were interspersed
amongst them; and seen smoking in all directions, increased the
singularity of the scene.


Following the course of a small stream which rose in the Mei-ling
mountain and flowed through the valley, we arrived at the small
village of Choong-chun about half way on our journey from Nan-kan-foo.
At this place we found refreshment prepared for us at a comfortable
house. I here found myself too fatigued with the first strong exercise
that I had taken since my illness, to continue my journey on horseback.
A mandarin who accompanied us saw my situation, and immediately
procured me a chair. The horse was put in charge of a soldier, who
was directed to follow me, that I might re-mount in any part of the
road for the sake of examining the country. This man proved a true
Chinese. He mounted the horse, and having gradually fallen back
out of reach of our observation, rode off, and no more appeared.  
  
  
  B B
<!-- Leaf 234, Page: 186 -->

There was nothing very remarkable in the village of
Choongchun. It consisted of a long narrow street of sheds, for the
accommodation of the coolies employed in transporting goods across
the mountain, and of the usual proportion of public houses of
retirement.


Leaving this place, we entered an extensive undulated plain,
dreary and barren, and in about four hours reached the suburbs of
Nan-hiung-foo. Within a short distance of the city we fell in with a
large body of military, who exhibited a solitary instance of
something martial in China, even to the eyes of Europeans.


I have not given any account of the different military posts which
we passed in our progress through China, because details of this kind
may be found in various authors, and because they afforded me no
opportunity of estimating the probable amount of the military force
of the empire. I may, however, hazard the general observation,
that in discipline and costume the Chinese soldiers seemed better
adapted to grace the representations of a theatre, and in many
instances a mountebank stage, than for the defence of the empire.
This observation, indeed, applied less to the body of men who waited
the arrival of the British Ambassador, at the suburbs of
Nan-hiungfoo, than to any other that we had seen in China. They were
generally fine athletic men, and had a soldier's port. Their arms and
uniform were simple, clean, and effective. The cavalry, whom I
saw dismounted, were armed with bows and arrows, and wore
white linen jackets faced with red. The infantry, armed with
match-locks supported on cross sticks, wore red, faced with white.
But however complete the appointment of Chinese soldiers, they lose
all their imposing character in the eyes of a European during their
degrading salute to an officer of rank. Let my reader imagine a
whole regiment in line, at the word of command, clapping their hands
to their sides, falling upon their knees, and uttering a dismal howl,
and he will have some idea of this august ceremony.

On approaching the city we passed through a succession of
<!-- Leaf 235, Page: 187 -->
triumphal arches* ornamented in the Chinese taste, with various colours.
The city proved of great extent, and as far as a passing
observation could enable me to form an opinion, was more populous and
better built than any that I had seen on the northern side of
Meiling. Our Chinese conductors, to impress us with its extent, led
us through every street, that could be traversed in our way to the
building prepared for our reception. I saw nothing, however, to
change the opinion that all Chinese cities are built on the same plan,
and that having seen one, a tolerably accurate notion may be formed
of all the others. Du Haide has made the same observation, and
Avas so convinced of its correctness as to give, in his History of
China, only one general description of a Chinese city. The picture
that he has drawn, although highly coloured with regard to beautiful
temples and monuments dedicated to the brave and good, is in all
other respects so accordant with our experience, that I give it to the
reader as a very accurate painting.


\"f The cities of China are generally of a square form, surrounded
with lofty walls having projecting towers at regular intervals, and


* The most common of these more resemble a gallows, than any other fabric to which
I can compare them.


f Elles sont la plupart de figure quarree, lorsque le terrain le comporte, et environnees
de hautes murailles, avec des tours d'espace en espace qui y sont adossees: elles ont
quelquefois des fossez, ou sees ou pleins d'eau. On y voit d'autres tours ou rondes, ou
hexagones, ou octogones, qui ont jusqu'a huit ou neuf etages, des arcs de triomphe dans les
rue's, d'assez beaux temples consacrez aux idoles, ou des monumens erigez en l'honneur des
heros de la nation, et de ceux qui ont rendu quelque service important a l'etat et au bien

par leur magnificence. Ajoutez a cela quelques places assez grandes, de longues rues, les

Igg CHINESE CITIES.

are usually encompassed by a ditch either dry or full of water.
Distributed through the streets and squares, or situated in the
vicinity of the principal gates, are round, hexagonal, or octagonal
towers of unequal height, triumphal arches, beautiful temples
dedicated to idols, and monuments erected in honour of the heroes
of the nation, or of those who have rendered important benefits
to the state or to the people; and lastly, some public buildings
more remarkable for extent than magnificence. The squares are
large, the streets long and of variable breadth, some Avide, others
narrow; the houses have for the most part but a ground floor, and
rarely exceed one story. The shops are varnished, and ornamented
with silk and porcelain. Before each door is fixed a painted and
gilded board seven or eight feet high, supported on a pedestal, and
having inscribed on it three large characters chosen by the merchant
for the sign of his shop, and distinguishing it from all others. To
these are often added a list of the articles to be disposed of, and the
name of the seller. Under all, and conspicuous by their size, are
the characters Pou-hou, ' No cheating here.'"*


Such is Du Halde's description of a Chinese city, and the notion
it conveys of the distribution of the temples, streets, and shops, will
answer for the greater number of cities in the empire. The
modifications are not many, and depend on mere localities. Thus, where
stone is readily had, the streets are paved much in the manner of
European cities; but in Tong-Chow, built on an alluvial soil
remarkably free from all stones, the streets are without pavement,
and cut into deep ruts. Another peculiarity of certain Chinese
cities, is the quantity of land included and cultivated within the walls.


* A writer not very favourable to the Chinese has observed, that unless they were
predetermined to cheat they would not place these characters before their shops. " II ne
reste done apres tout ceci que l'extreme bonne-foi des marchands Chinois, qui sont
assureruent de grands moralistes; puisqu'ils ecrivent a Pentree de toutes leurs boutiques,
Pouhou, e'est-a-dire, ' ici on ne trompe personne.' Ce qu'ils n'auroient point pense a ecrire,
s'ils n'avoient ete tres resolus d'avance de tromper tout le monde." De Pauw sur les
Chinois, torn. i. p. 9 et 10.
<!-- Leaf 237, Page: 189 -->
Common to many, not mentioned in Du Haide, but described by
Mr. Barow, are the screens thrown across the streets from house to
house, affording to the passengers shelter from the sun and rain.


In passing through Nan-hiung-foo, we met with many indications
of our arrival in a province where we were known as Hung-mous,
or Englishmen, a people looked upon as very little removed from
barbarism by the Chinese of Canton. Some of the gentlemen, in
riding through the city, were saluted by the mob with the
appellation of Fan-qui, or foreign devils, and were much pressed by the
crowd. It was in vain to attempt to escape them by hard riding, as
every part of the street was filled with people, and those who ran
behind cheered and kept up with their game. One or two
gentlemen could not quietly endure their insults, but turning their
horses, charged into the mob. They at once fled in all directions,
and although they did not cease their abuse, kept at a more tolerable
distance.


The boats in readiness to receive us at this place, with the
exception of those for the commissioners, were, in the state in which
we found them, too comfortless to be taken possession of. They had
no covering but mats, were open from stem to stern, and were so
low that it was impossible to move in them but with the body bent
at right angles. Their holds, full of water, were only separated from
the cabin by an open bamboo railing. I must confess, that being
threatened with a return of my illness in consequence of the fatigue of
the journey across the mountain, I shuddered at such accommodation,
but was saved from its probable consequences by the kindness of Mr.
Ellis, who gave me a share of his boat. The other gentlemen with
great difficulty, and reiterated representations to the local authorities,
obtained partitions to separate them from the boatmen. These
trivial embarrassments encountered by travellers as a necessary
consequence of the habits of the country, would have been quietly
endured; but in China, where we saw the means of better
accommodation at hand, where it was withheld from us by the local
authorities from their contempt of our national character, such barefaced
<!-- Leaf 238, Page: 190 -->
neglect of the common offices of hospitality was in the highest degree
irritating.


We went on board on the evening of the 21st, intending to sail
at an early hour the next morning.


On the morning of the 22d, some time after the Legate had got
under weigh, and when the boats of the Embassy were preparing
to follow him, it was ascertained that many of them, especially those
of the guard and band, had received no provisions. The commissioners
becoming acquainted with this circumstance, peremptorily ordered
their boatmen to anchor. His Excellency sent word to the necessary
authorities that he would not again move till he received information
from each boat that it was properly supplied, but would then give the
signal for departure. This decision brought the Chinese to a due
sense of propriety. They rapidly sent down every thing that was
required, but it was two in the afternoon before they had provisioned
all the boats. The Ambassador then ordered his boatmen to weigh,
and was followed by the whole fleet.


Many of the boatmen on this occasion, opposed in a determined
manner the order for halting, by persisting to pole along their
boats, but were brought to obedience by a demonstration of personal
opposition.


The extreme shallowness of the river prevented our making much
progress during the first two days after leaving Nang-hiung-foo; but
the forms and structure of the mountains between which we were
passing, rendered the voyage very interesting. During the 22d, they
were at too great a distance to admit any conjecture respecting their
composition during our passage, or of a visit to them during the
short continuance of day-light after the anchoring of the boats in the
evening.


During our second day's progress, the hills which formed the banks
of the river exhibited a breccial formation at their base, covered
with beds of ferruginous clay, giving to the soil, through a great
extent of country, a remarkable redness. Bricks Avere making of this,
in kilns spread over its surface, which came from the furnace of a
bluish colour. I have found the same effect to be produced on small
<!-- Leaf 239, Page: 191 -->
quantities of it, subjected to the heat of a common stove. Towards
evening we occasionally passed rocks in an undecomposed state,
that exhibited the same colour as the beds of clay. Their strata
were sometimes inclined, and had beds of fine gravel interposed
between them.


On anchoring in the evening, I examined some rocks similar to
those by which we had passed, and found that they changed their
red colour beneath the surface, and became of a bluish gray. When
disintegrated, they formed the clay soil before mentioned.


These rocks, which near the surface might be said to be
composed of argillaceous sand-stone of a coarse grain, passed lower down
into pudding stone, containing rounded fragments of quartz and
decomposed crystals of felspar.


On the 24th the country improved in appearance; the rocks
which had the day before been uniformly bare, were now clothed
with groves of pine. Large rafts "of its timber were floating down
the stream. In a memorandum attached to a drawing of the
Pinus lanceolata at the India House, it is stated that the rafts of
timber floated down to Canton are formed of this tree. This, I
apprehend, is an error. We never found the Pinus lanceolata in
groves, but scattered amongst the Pinus Massoniana• and, as I have
before mentioned, generally of a small size. The rafts which we saw
both on the northern and southern side of Mei-ling were certainly
formed chiefly of the former plant. I use the qualification chiefly,
because I am not quite certain that another pine, allied to the Pinus
paludosus, does not sometimes occur in the groves. The botanic
gardener thought so, but did not satisfy me of the fact by any
specimens. All the groves I saw in China were of the Pinus
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P239_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 240, Page: 192 -->
Massoniana, a specimen of which I have recovered through Sir George
Staunton, and have examined others in the Herbarium of Sir Joseph
Banks, brought over by Lord Macartney from the province of
Kiangnan. This tree, it would appear, is one of the most widely diffused
plants on the continent of China. We met with it through more
than ten degrees of north latitude and six of east longitude.


The rafts are very singular objects in the eyes of a stranger,
consisting of an indefinite number of smaller rafts, fastened together
and covered with the dwellings of their managers. The smaller rafts
are usually ten feet wide, and five above the surface of the water.
They are joined together by twisted osiers, and thus extend, as
affirmed by Du Haide and other writers, to more than a mile in
length, and are numerous in proportion as the timber-merchant is
rich, and are so connected that they move as easily as the links of a
chain. Four or five men guide them before with poles and oars, and
others assist along the sides, at equal distances. They live in wooden
houses, and sell their dwellings at the different cities where they
sell the timber; but sometimes, it is said, they navigate a hundred
leagues in transporting it to Pekin.


When the boats anchored in the evening, I again examined the
rocks in our neighbourhood, and found them composed of red
sandstone of a finer grain than those I have before described. One of
them was remarkable for a vein of pudding stone, composed of quartz,
pebbles, and the shift which is represented in the sketch.
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P240_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 241, Page: 193 -->

The next morning I rose early, in the hope of viewing some strange
shaped rocks seen at a distance the preceding evening, and was
not disappointed. The forms of those which now skirted both
banks of the river, partaking largely of the usual grotesque characters
of mountain scenery in China, were too numerous to admit any
detailed description. Much of the singularity of the scenery,
however, was occasioned by very rugged rocks contrasting with others of
an uninterrupted surface. Limestone rocks, apparently made up of
immense masses heaped confusedly together, were often opposed to
others of sandstone, rising with an extensive and even front to a
great elevation. Occasionally they formed a channel for the river,
so winding and narrow, that they seemed to terminate its course.


Amidst this interesting scenery a marbled rock on the right bank,
rising perpendicularly from the surface of the water to the height
of tAvo or three hundred feet, particularly arrested my attention.
I call it a marbled rock, because its surface was of a fine red
colour, covered in places with a stalactitic incrustation of a delicate
whiteness. I landed at its foot, and found it resting on a breccia
formed of fragments of grey compact limestone, of a calcareous red
sandstone, and of rounded fragments of quartz, cemented by a fine
grained red and white limestone. Many of the fragments of
limestone had the same characters as the rocks in the valley of Mei-ling,
and were, perhaps, derived from them. The breccia rose only a few
feet above the water. The principal mass of rock resting upon it
exhibited no stratification, but appeared to be one entire mass of
finegrained flesh-red granular limestone.


Further down the river we passed other rocks of a breccial
character, but having their component parts on so large a scale,
that they could be distinguished at a considerable distance. When
close to us, many of the fragments appeared to be from forty to
sixty feet square, and generally had defined edges and angles: the
fragments were of a gray, the connecting medium of a red colour.
I have endeavoured to represent their general aspect in the upper  
  
  
  c c
<!-- Leaf 242, Page: 194 -->
plate of the geological views in China. The surfaces of many of
these rocks could not have appeared more bare, even, and
perpendicular, had they been formed by the hand of art.


The vegetation on the surface of the hills least decomposed
sometimes consisted of a species of Lycopodium resembling a tree in
miniature. An exaggerated figure is given of this plant in number
two hundred and thirty-eight of the botanical drawings in the India
House. The head is not so thick as is there represented, but is more
umbrella-shaped, and spreading.


A few miles before we reached Chaou-chou-foo the banks of the
river became lower, and resumed the red colour arising from
disintegrated red sandstone, and were in some places of a blackish hue. This
last circumstance arose from a quantity of coal which we here found
rising through the surface. Some pits * of coal had been met with
bysome of the Embassy soon after leaving the Po-yang lake, but I
had not been well enough to examine them. However, 1 received
sufficient evidences of coal being abundant in the empire, and of
various qualities, in the large supplies of it furnished to our boats,
and exposed for sale in different cities that we visited.-j- The coal
which I saw in the province of Pe-tche-lee was a species of graphite;
that brought to me from the towns on the Yang-tse-kiang, resembled
cannel coal; that observed after passing the Po-yang lake had the
characters of kovey coal; that now met with, contained much
sulphur.


The last-mentioned coal was used in the manufacture of sulphate of
iron, in the neighbourhood of Chaou-chou-foo. The followingpro
* " Foo-hoo-tang appearing an insignificant village, we took a short walk into the
country, where we met with some pits of coal that had been sunk like wells; the fragments
at the bottom of the hill where they were situated appeared pure slate."—Ellis's Embassy,
vol. ii. p. 107.

t " The Missionaries inform us that coal mines are so abundant in every province of
China, that there is, perhaps, no country of the world in which they are so common."
See Grosier's Account of China, vol. i. p. 402.
<!-- Leaf 243, Page: 195 -->
cess, in its different stages, was witnessed by several gentlemen of the
Embassy. A quantity of hepatic iron pyrites, in very small pieces,
mixed with about an equal quantity of the coal in the same state, being
formed into a heap, was covered with a coating of lime-plaster. In a
short time great action took place in the mass, accompanied by the
extrication of much heat and smoke, and was allowed to go on till it
spontaneously ceased. The heap was then broken up and put into
water, which was afterwards boiled till considerably reduced in
quantity, and was then evaporated in shallow vessels. Very pure crystals
of sulphate of iron were obtained at the close of the process.


We reached Chaou-chou-foo at four o'clock in the afternoon of
the 25th, and anchored on the left of the river: the city is on the
right bank, and communicates with the left by a bridge of boats.
Here again we were made sensible of our approach to Canton by
being prohibited from entering the city. Two or three gentlemen,
however, succeeded in reaching it, but found nothing peculiar in the
style of its buildings. I also made an attempt, but was less fortunate
than my companions. The morning after our arrival, seeing a
number of people passing over the bridge, I hoped, by mingling with
them, to succeed in crossing the river, but found, on approaching
the middle of the bridge, that the central boat had been
withdrawn. In the hope that it would be replaced, I sat down on the
side of the next, and was soon surrounded by a crowd delayed
by the same circumstance, but who were not permitted to pass
till they had driven me aAvay by their usual importunate
curiosity. I now went to a Canton linguist who attended the Embassy,
and requested him to procure me a boat, promising not to enter
the city, but to confine my visit to a singularly shaped black rock
in its vicinity. After a little hesitation he seemingly assented, and
ordered a boat to receive me, but gave the boatmen some
directions in Chinese which I did not understand. I soon, however,
discovered their import, for when the boatmen had taken me two
or three hundred yards up the river, they endeavoured to land
me on the same side that I had left. It being in vain to
exposc c 2
<!-- Leaf 244, Page: 196 -->
tulate, I returned to the linguist, not a little incensed at the trick
he had played me. He received my complaint very coolly, and
frankly replied that it had been necessary to get rid of me, as I
gave him " too much a trump," the Canton-English for too much
trouble.


At Chaou-chou-foo the uncomfortable matted boats were changed
for others which were large, commodious, and handsome. We
entered them in high spirits on the morning of the 27th, hoping in a
few days to be clear of a people whose character rarely presented
itself in any amiable light.


Having passed, during the first day, through a country exhibiting
no characters worth noting, the Embassy halted on the morning of the
28th before a temple built in the fissure of a rock, and which is
represented, as it appeared when close to us, in the annexed engraving.

With our imaginations warmed by its beautiful and romantic
description* by an elegant writer, we were surprised at landing on a


* Those of my readers who have not before read the following description, will thank
me for its insertion, although it occupies a long note.

\"Before we had proceeded many hundred yards we were attracted to the left by an
arm of the river, which, after stretching considerably from the main stream, had bent and
elbowed itself into a deep cove or basin, above which enormous masses of rock rose
abruptly on every side, agglomerating to a stupendous height, and menacing collision.
The included flood was motionless, silent, sullen, black. The ledge where we landed was
so narrow, that we could not stand upon it without difficulty; we were hemmed round
with danger. The mountains frowned on us from on high; the precipices startled us
from beneath. Our own safety seemed even in the jaws of a cavern that yawned in our
front. We plunged into it without hesitating, and, for a moment, felt the joys of a sudden
escape: but our terrors returned when we surveyed our asylum. We found ourselves at
the bottom of a staircase hewn in the rock, long, narrow, steep, and rugged. At a
distance a feeble taper glimmered from above, and faintly discovered to us the secrets of the
vault. We, however, looked forward to it as our pole star; we scrambled up the steps,
and with much trouble and fatigue arrived at the landing-place. Here an ancient
baldheaded Bonze issued from his den, and offered himself as our conductor through this
subterranean labyrinth. The first place he led us to was the grand hall or refectory of the
convent. It is an excavation forming nearly a cube of twenty-five feet, through one face
of which is a considerable opening that looks over the water, and is barricadoed with a rail.
This apartment is well furnished in the taste of the country with tables and chairs highly
varnished, and with many gauze and paper lanthorns of various colours, in the middle of
<!-- Leaf 247, Page: 197 -->
broad platform, a few feet above the water, and at ascending by an
easy flight of steps to the first division of the temple; an ample
cavern, cold, dark, and dismal. A few grinning bonzes, with bare
heads and long cloaks, received us at the entrance, and conducted us
through the vault up another flight of steps to the second story.
Here we again looked round on the bare rock projecting abruptly
into a capacious but gloomy apartment. At an opening in its front

which was suspended a glass lanthorn of prodigious size made in London, the offering of
an opulent Chinese bigot at Canton. From hence we mounted by an ascent of many
difficult steps to the temple itself, which is directly over the hall, but of much greater
extent. Here the god Pusa is displayed in all his glory, a gigantic image with a Saracen
face, grinning horribly from a double row of gilded fangs, a crown upon his head, a naked
cimetar in one hand, and a firebrand in the other. But how little, alas! is celestial or
sublunary fame; I could learn very few particulars of this colossal divinity: even the
Bonzes, who live by his worship, scarcely knew any thing of his history. From the
attributes he is armed with, I suppose he was some great Tartar prince or commander of
antiquity; but if he bore any resemblance to his representative, he must have been a most
formidable warrior, and probably not inferior in his day to the king of Prussia or prince
Ferdinand in our own. A magnificent altar was dressed out at his feet, with lamps,
lanthorns, candles and candlesticks, censers and perfumes, strongly resembling the decorations
ofa Romish chapel, and on the walls were hung numerous tablets inscribed in large
characters, with moral sentences and exhortations to pious alms and religion.


\"Opposite to the image is a wide breach in the wall, down from which the perpendicular
view requires the firmest nerves and the steadiest head to resist its impression. The
convulsed rocks above shooting their tottering shadows into the distant light, the slumbering
abyss below, the superstitious gloom brooding upon the whole, all conspired to strike the
mind with accumulated horror and the most terrifying images. From the chsipel we were
led through several long and narrow galleries to the rest of the apartments, which had
been all wrought in the rock, by invincible labor and perseverance, into kitchens, cells,
cellars, and other recesses of various kinds. The Bonzes having now heard the quality of
their visitors, had lighted an additional number of torches and flambeaux, by which we
were enabled to see all the interior of the souterrain, and to examine into the nature of
its inhabitants, and their manner of living in it. Here we beheld a number of our fellow
creatures endowed with faculties like our own, (" some breasts once pregnant with celestial
fire") buried under a mountain, and chained to a rock to be incessantly gnawed by the
vultures of superstition and fanaticism. Their condition appeared to us to be the last
stage of monastic misery, the lowest degradation of humanity. The aspiring thoughts
and elegant desires, the Promethean heat, the nobler energies of the soul, the native dignity
of man, all sunk, rotting, or extinguished in a hopeless dungeon of religious insanity.
From such scenes the offended eye turns away with pity and disdain, and looks with
impatience for a ray of relief from the light of reason and philosophy." Journal of an
Embassy to China by Lord Macartney, p.374.
<!-- Leaf 248, Page: 198 -->
we looked downwards upon the river from the probable height of one
hundred feet. Upwards the view was interrupted by overhanging
rocks of a stalactical appearance.


This temple, dedicated to Quong-ying, had evidently undergone
much alteration since it was visited by Lord Macartney's mission.
In vain did we seek for those circumstances of terror and danger so
impressively pourtrayed by his Lordship. The " gigantic image with
a Saracen face, grinning horribly from a double row of gilded fangs,"
had disappeared, and had not been succeeded by any other that struck
us either with awe or wonder. We descended, indeed, with those
feelings of disappointment which are the general consequence of
highly raised expectation. Had we come upon this really interesting
temple without warning, had we never read the pages of Lord
Macartney, our astonishment and admiration might have equalled
his own; but prepared for wonders, painted perhaps, rather in our
imagination than in his description, we turned away dissatisfied from
a gloomy cave the befitting residence of ignorance and superstition.
The vacant countenances of the few monks who inhabited the rock,
bespoke no sympathy or participation in the ordinary sufferings
or enjoyments of human nature. Arrived at the bottom, I entered
with Mr. Hayne, to the left of the temple, a small opening in the
rock, apparently leading to its inmost recesses. Having obtained
lights we prepared to explore them, but had not proceeded many steps,
when certain odours unequivocally revealed their " hidden secrets,"
and warned us to retreat. A stranger in China rarely experiences a
pleasing emotion without its being destroyed by some circumstance
offensive to the senses.


The Quong-ying rock is composed of the grayish black transition
limestone of Werner, and is remarkable in some parts for its
irregugular vesicular surface. Some of the hollows were so large that they
seemed to have been formed by the falling out of organic remains,
but afforded no sufficient evidence of the fact. From the bonzes I

procured some specimens of the overhanging rocks resembling
stalactites, and found them of the same composition as the rock itself.  
  
  
  It might have been imagined that monks shut out from the
<!-- Leaf 249, Page: 199 -->
world would be little sensible of the value of money, and still
less capable of unfair means of obtaining it. They showed
themselves, however, equally prone to impose with any of their
countrymen, when they found us inclined to purchase some fragments of
rock which decorated a small table or altar placed beneath one of
their idols. At first they freely gave us any specimen that we wished
to possess, but having received a three shilling piece in return from
one of the gentlemen, they no longer made gratuitous offerings,
but enhanced the price to each succeeding person that visited the
temple.


Having satisfied ourselves with its examination, we again
continued on our route through a mountainous country, and halted the
next day near a narrow pass formed by rugged rocks projecting from
both banks of the river.


The hills in the neighbourhood of our anchorage were composed of
grayish yellow argillaceous sandstone of a fine grain, intersected in
every direction by veins of quartz. They were more productive in
native plants than most that I had before visited, but were entirely
uncultivated. The Myrtus tomentosus grew to a greater size and in
higher beauty than I had elsewhere seen it, and was in great
abundance. In scarcely less quantity was the Smilax China, famed for its
sudorific properties, and a species which I could not distinguish from
Smilax lanceolata. The gardener brought me a specimen of a Begonia
resembling Begonia grandis, which he had found growing against
the exposed surface of a rock to the height of twenty feet. Here
also we collected specimens of a Camellia growing wild that we had
not before met with, but which was probably a variety of the Camellia
oleifera, yet differed from it in the narrowness of its leaves and
smallness of its blossoms. The rocky banks of some small streams
were covered with a species of Marchantia in full fruit, and one or
two species of Jungermania. Two Rhexias of doubtful species grew
in the rocks, and several plants of questionable genera.


Plantations of sugar-cane had been frequent in this part of our
route as well as in the southern part of the province of Kiang-si.
<!-- Leaf 250, Page: 200 -->
The plants were growing to the height of seven or eight feet, and
three or four inches in diameter. The mills in which the sugar
was expressed appeared to be of a similar construction to one figured
by Dr. Buchanan in his work on India. * It consisted of two
upright cylinders of wood or stone, worked by buffaloes yoked to a
long beam passing from the top of one of the cylinders. It was fed
by introducing the cane between the cylinders whilst in action.
The juice thus expressed was conducted by a channel into a large
reservoir, and was thence transferred into boilers, whence having been
sufficiently inspissated, it Avas conveyed into pail-shaped vessels about
three feet deep and tAvo Avide, for the purpose of being transported
to the refiners or to the market. The sugar thus obtained is very
coarse, but undergoes some subsequent process of refinement that
we had no opportunity of witnessing. It was sent to our boats of
various degrees of purity and colour, but seldom of a very fine quality.
A very white powder sugar, much used by Europeans at Canton, is
pulverised sugar candy. The manufacture of the last article is said
by De Guignes f* to be confined in a good measure to Chin-tcheou,
the capital of Fokien. A better kind than any made in the country
is imported from Cochin-china.


The buffaloes that work the mills live upon the refuse of the sugar

those of Java, betrayed the greatest alarm at our approach.  
  
  
  The sugar cane plantations are irrigated by the mills so well described  
  
  
  and accurately figured by the late Sir George Staunton; and are
equally remarkable for simplicity, ingenuity, and efficiency. It is
impossible to view these machines without giving the Chinese credit for
not only using great skill, but much mathematical precision in their

construction. They are made entirely of bamboo without any metallic
fastenings, and are therefore so light as to turn with the slightest
impulse from the stream. When in a state of perfect repair, for the
greater number of those which we saAv Avere far otherwise, the hollow
bamboos fixed to their circumference and acting as buckets, are set
on at so nice an angle, that they deliver the water into the trough
with scarcely any loss. The height of these wheels vary with that
of the bank over Avhich they raise the water.


The Embassy having been for many weeks passing through a
very mountainous country, I had looked with some anxiety for
examples of that system of terrace cultivation, for which China has
been famed by all its early describers; but saAv none that satisfied the
expectation Avhich had been raised by the glowing descriptions of
various authors. Like one of the missionaries*, I had imagined China
to be an immense garden, cultivated with infinite care, and receiving
its chief embellishment from mountains cut into terraces productive
in all kinds of vegetable food; and, like him, I was disappointed in
finding them very frequently barren of the means of subsistence, from
the base to the summit. Indeed, I apprehend that no belief can be
less founded on fact, than that the Chinese are in the common practice
of rendering the surface of mountains naturally sterile, productive by
any mode of cultivation. The instances of the terracing of hills
which I had an opportunity of observing, lead me to believe that it is
in a very great measure confined to their ravines, to their undulations,
and to their gentlest declivities; in other Avords, to those situations
where an accumulation of their degraded surface, affords a soil
naturally fertile.


That hills formed of alluvial deposit, and having a soil more than
a hundred feet in depth, are covered through the medium of terrace


* " En entrant dans le Kian-si j'appercus a parti de moi, des montagnes arides, et au
bas, point ou presque point de terrein a cultiver. Je m'etais figure qu'elle resemblait a un
vaste jardin cultive avec beaucoup d'art et de soin." The same author elsewhere states,
that in travelling over a portion of China almost equal to France, he saw, " ni bois, ni
fontaines, ni jardins, ni arbris fruitiers, ni vignes." Pere Burgeois, Memoires concernant
les Chinois, vol. viii. p. 293, &c.

cultivation with a succession of gardens, in some parts of China, as
stated by Du Haide, I can believe, because I have found that author
generally accurate in his statements of matters of fact; but I equally
believe that under the most favourable circumstances, terrace
cultivation is not a favourite process Avith the Chinese, but is only resorted to
by them Avhen they cannot obtain the full means of subsistence from the
plains. On this subject my experience agrees with that of Mr. Barrow,
and with a still later author, M. De Guignes, Avho accompanied the
Dutch embassy. The former has had occasion to observe, that in his
whole route, terrace cultivation " occurred on so small a scale as hardly
to deserve notice;" and the latter has remarked that, although he
certainly saAv small fields cultivated on the very tops of some mountains in
a certain canton of Kiang-nan, Avhere the mountainous and contracted
nature of the country had obliged the inhabitants to do so; yet he
had traversed districts filled with mountains, of which no portion was
thrown into cultivation. The same author states, that whenever the
flat country is sufficient for the nourishment of the inhabitants, the
slightest elevations are suffered to remain untilled. I may add on this
subject, that we often passed mountains equally capable of cultivation
with others that were terraced, but on which we could distinguish no
trace of tillage.


Du Haide has given a chapter on the abundance Avhich prevails in
China, in Avhich he has assembled in a few pages descriptions of all
the various trees and vegetables which supply the wants of its
inhabitants, and are scattered through an empire embracing in its range of
latitude a temperate and tropical climate. These, displayed in so
compressed a view and as illustrative of the general fertility of the
empire, have led, I conceive, to very mistaken conclusions
respecting the general productiveness of the soil. In some districts, perhaps,
in which peculiar causes have operated, as in the neighbourhood of
tea countries, for instance, " the Avhole surface is, with trifling
exceptions, dedicated to the production of food for man alone;" but this
proposition does not certainly apply to the whole empire.*  
  
  
  * See Malthus on Population.
<!-- Leaf 253, Page: 203 -->

Of that part of China passed through by the Embassy, I may
venture to say that the quantity of land very feebly productive in
food for man fully equalled that which afforded it in abundant
quantity. In the province of Pe-tchee-lee the banks of the river were
often alone cultivated, and even these, when of a sandy nature, were
left untilled. In the province of Shan-tung, great part of the land
on both sides the canal, especially in its northern part, had " suffered
so severely from inundation," that it was impossible " to form a
correct opinion of its general appearance."* The quantity of the
Nelumbium and Trapa, however, which continually appeared, renders it
highly probable that it is at all times very swampy. The province
of Kiang-nan, especially in its northern part, was highly fertile; but
towards its southern boundary it became hilly, and more productive
in timber than in corn. The province of Kiang-si Avas
mountainous, and although generally affording the oil, tallow, varnish,
fir and camphor trees, frequently offered to our view, for several
miles, no appearance of vegetable cultivation except in the hollows
of the hills, or in the occasional fall of the land towards the river.
In the province of Quang-tong, from the time of crossing the
Meiling mountain till within two days sail of Canton, we met with little
else than a succession of sterile mountains, which so much astonished
the Pere Bourgeois on his first entrance into China.


I have already stated that hills capable of terrace cultivation are
often entirely untilled, and I may now make a similar observation,
but with greater limitation, respecting the plains. I might here
quote the declarations of those authors who assert that whole districts
in China are uncultivated and uninhabited, or of those who have Avith
justice pointed out the quantity of land occupied by the burying
places of the Chinese; but I shall content myself with observing, that
\"much land capable of tillage" -f is " left neglected," and I mean land
capable of that kind of tillage which is understood by the inhabitants.

<!-- Leaf 254, Page: 204 -->
I often noticed portions of land even in the vicinity of cottages and
villages, remaining waste for no other conceivable reason than
because its culture was unnecessary to the support of the neighbouring
inhabitants. These facts, which might be deemed of too little
importance for insertion in an account of any other country, are of
consequence as they regard China, a country of which it has been
asserted that " not an inch of ground is left uncultivated."


With respect to the numerical amount of the population of China,
we obtained no new data by which to judge of the relative degrees of
probability due to the discordant and irreconcileable accounts of
different writers.* The apparent population, however, was not such as
those statements had led me to expect. The cities, indeed, were well
peopled, and under the circumstances in Avhich we saw them,
sometimes over-peopled, but the intermediate land seldom appeared fully
stocked with inhabitants. But the multitudes who croAvded around
us in some of the larger towns and cities Avere so undoubtedly swelled
from sources not contained within themselves, that any calculation
which might have been attempted respecting them Avould have been
liable to egregious error. De Guignes asserts £hat many of the
cities which poured forth such astonishing multitudes when visited
by Lord Macartney's Embassy, exhibited to the Dutch Mission, in
the folloAving year, no evidences of excessive population. The
different circumstances attending the two embassies were the probable
causes of this contrariety of experience. Lord Macartney's Embassy
was, perhaps, the most splendid that had ever appeared in China
from a European state: it was from a nation whom the Chinese
government especially wished to impress with an exalted notion of


* In the year 1743 the population of China, according to the Missionaries, amounted
to 150,265,475; in 1761, according to Father Allerstan, to 198,214,552; in 1794,
according to the statement given to Lord Macartney, to 330,000,000; in 1817, when Lord
Amherst's Embassy was at Canton, the most generally received calculation as applicable
to4he present state of China, was that of Father Amiot, taken in 1777, which gave the
population at 197,000,000. A gentleman highly competent to form an opinion on this
subject estimated it much lower.
<!-- Leaf 255, Page: 205 -->
its resources; and it contained the only foreigners that had ever been
seen in many of the provinces which it traversed. The influence
of the government, therefore, no less than the curiosity of the people,
contributed to depopulate the country in the vicinity of its route,
and to concentrate the inhabitants in the cities by which it might
pass: Lord Amherst's Embassy was in nearly the same
circumstances. The Dutch Embassy, on the contrary, little respected by the
government, and following immediately after Lord Macartney's
imposing mission, would modify in a much less degree the ordinary
appearance of population, and consequently be in circumstances more
faA^ourable to a correct estimate of its amount.


I apprehend, however, that any person travelling through a country
in a hurried journey, under a suspicious surveillance, must always be
unqualified to pronounce on a question that respects a whole nation;
and I shall, therefore, make no further remark on this subject, than
that the A^isible population of China did not appear " more than
commensurate with the quality of land under actual cultivation."*


In proportion as Ave approached Canton, the river widened and
deepened, and the country opened and became more flat on both sides.
Groves of orange trees, of bananas, and of the rose apple, frequently
relieved extensive rice fields. The scene had, however, a dreary
sameness, which Avould have been a little irksome to our feelings, had
we been further from the termination of our journey; but our near
approach to the society of our countrymen, to a re-union with our
shipmates, and, above all, to intelligence of our friends in England,
gave us prospects too interesting to be relinquished for the
soberness of reality.


On the morning of the 1st of January, the trampling and yells of
our boatmen getting under weigh at an early hour, which had so
often disturbed our rest, and driven us from our beds execrating every
thing Chinese, now sounded to us like grateful music, and seemed in
unison with the throbbings of elated hope. We arose, and gliding  
  
  
  * Ellis's Embassy, vol. ii. p. 207.
<!-- Leaf 256, Page: 206 -->
swiftly down a broad and rapid stream, descried about noon, the
British flag flying at some distance, and soon after, a British boat
in advance of several others. " Captain MaxAvell and the Alceste's
boats !" was the joyful exclamation through our fleet. Our
anticipations Avere soon verified. Captain Maxwell, accompanied by Sir
Theophilus Metcalfe in the Ambassador's barge, preceded the other
boats of the Alceste, and of all the British ships at that time in the
Canton river, containing Captain Hall of the Lyra, and their other
respective officers, and many gentlemen of the Canton factory. On
this occasion Mr. Wilcocks the American consul, with his usual
liberality of character, joined the procession in his own barge, to
congratulate His Excellency on his safe arrival at Canton.


The boats having rowed round the different yachts and received
His Excellency and the gentlemen of his suite, advanced in two lines
till within half a mile of the city of Canton. His Lordship's barge
then halted, whilst the other boats went a-head and landed the
gentlemen of the factory and of his suite at the entrance to the quarters
prepared for the Embassy, at a temple in the village of Honan, on
the opposite side of the river to tbe British factory. They were
here joined by the gentlemen of the factory, who had been unable
to form part of the procession, and received the Ambassador and the
Commissioners on landing.


His Excellency was immediately conducted to a spacious, and,
Avhat had been rendered by the exertions of our Canton friends, a
splendid and comfortable establishment for the whole Embassy. A
temple had been given up for the purpose; and the paraphernalia
of idol worship had given place to the commodious furniture of
an English house. Leaving what, in our sudden transition from
confined boats, seemed little short of a paradise, we passed over the
water to partake of a sumptuous entertainment at the British
factory; and soon forgot, amidst the hospitality of our countrymen,
the inconveniences of our vexatious journey.
<!-- Leaf 257, Page: 207 -->
  
  CHAPTER VIII.

Various and deeply interesting were the events which had been
experienced by the Alceste and Lyra during our absence. We had to hear
a tale of discoveries accomplished in unknown seas amidst often
recurring, and as often conquered difficulties. Much had been expected
from the characters of the commanders, but more had been
accomplished than either time or opportunity had seemed likely to offer.
The gulfs of Pe-tche-lee and Leatong had been surveyed, and
communications held with the inhabitants oftheir shores; part of the
southwest coast of Corea had been examined, an enormous geographical
error respecting its position rectified, and its archipelago discovered;
the Lew-chewan islands had been visited, and their humane and
intelligent inhabitants impressed, through the Avise conduct of Captain
Maxwell, with the highest regard for the English character.


Leaving Lew-chew, the ships made for the coast of China, and
arrived off it on the 2d of November, Avhen the Lyra was dispatched
to Macao and the Alceste anchored off the island of Lin-tin. As
soon as Captain Maxwell could communicate with any Chinese
authorities, he applied to the viceroy for a pass to carry his ship up
the Canton river to a secure anchorage, and to a situation Avhere she
could undergo some necessary repairs. Evasion after evasion,
accompanied by insulting messages, Avere the only proofs that he obtained
of his application having been received. After waiting quietly for
some days, he determined, under the pilotage of Mr. Mayne the
master of the Alceste, to carry his ship to a safe birth up the river;
but had scarcely approached the Bocca Tigris, Avhen he received a
<!-- Leaf 258 -->
20g CANTON.

peremptory order to drop his anchor, or to proceed on his course at
the hazard of being sunk under the batteries at the entrance of the
river. He chose the latter alternative, and steered his ship close
under the principal fort, followed by a fleet of war junks. Both
junks and batteries immediately endeavoured to make good the threat
by opening a heavy fire. The return of a single shot silenced the
fleet, and when the guns could be brought to bear, one broadside
was sufficient for the batteries. After this affair the ship proceeded

quietly to her anchorage.

The effect of this decisive conduct was evinced the next day, by

the arrival of all kinds of supplies to the Alceste, and of a cargo
to the General Hewitt Indiaman, before withheld on the plea of
her being a tribute ship; and by the publication of an edict,
endeavouring to make the action appear to the Chinese as a mere salute.
Such is a rapid outline of occurrences which the interesting
narratives of Captain Hall and Mr. M'Leod have rendered a more
detailed account of unnecessary in this place.


The viceroy having been defeated in his attempts to intimidate or
cajole Captain Maxwell, hoped to recover his consequence in the
eyes of his countrymen by his treatment of the Ambassador. It was
known soon after our arrival at Canton that an imperial edict had been
received by the viceroy, giving a fallacious account of the transactions
of the Embassy, and directing him to invite the Ambassador to a
feast and to point out to him all the advantages that he had lost by
refusing to perform the ceremony of the Ko-tow. The words of the edict
Avill best explain their own purport. " When the Ambassadors arrive
at Canton, you will invite them to dinner in compliance Avith good
manners, and will make the following speech to them: " Your good
fortune has been small; you arrived at the gates of the imperial house,
and were unable to lift your eyes to the face of heaven (the emperor.)
The great emperor reflected that your king sighed after happiness
(China), and with sincerity. We therefore accepted some presents,
and gifted your king with various precious articles. You must return
thanks to the emperor for his benefits, and return with speed to
<!-- Leaf 259, Page: 209 -->
your kingdom, that your king may feel a respectful gratitude for
these acts of kindness. Take care to embark the rest of the presents
Avith safety, that they may not be lost or destroyed."


\"After this lecture should the Ambassador supplicate you to
receive the remainder of the presents, answer in one word, a decree
has passed, we therefore dare not present troublesome petitions, and
with decision you will rid yourself of them."


It was also ascertained that the viceroy had in charge a letter from the
Emperor to the Prince Regent, in delivering which to the Ambassador,
he was expected to follow the instructions of the edict. The letter was
delivered to His Excellency on the 7th of January, with much form
by the viceroy, but with only a feeble attempt to effect his intention.
The ceremony on this occasion was more imposing on the part of
the English than of the Chinese, and was chiefly interesting to us,
as affording the spectacle of a petty tyrant shrinking under the calm
dignity of an English nobleman. It commenced in a small open
building that might be called a temple, containing an altar decorated
with yellow silk, vessels of incense, and a variety of unintelligible
ornaments. Here the Viceroy, Foo-yuen and Hoppoo, received the
Emperor's letter, enclosed in a case of bamboo covered with yellow
silk, and brought in a sedan carried by thirty-six bearers; and
having performed the ceremony of prostration in private, awaited
the arrival of the Ambassador. His Excellency in his robes,
accompanied by Sir George Staunton and Mr. Ellis, attended by the
gentlemen of his suite and of the Factory, by Captain Hall, and several
other naval officers, and preceded by the guard and band, left his
house about noon for the conference. The guard and band having
formed into two lines within a few yards of the temple, the
Ambassador advanced between them, somewhat in front of his train, to the
steps of the building, and on ascending them was met by the viceroy.
A slight salutation having passed, the viceroy took the letter off the
altar, and holding it in both hands above his head, gave it to the
Ambassador, who received it in the same manner; and with like
form transferred it to his private secretary, raised his hat and bowed.

21q CEREMONY.

The whole party then adjourned to another decorated building, to
continue the conference. Three persons on each side were alone
allowed to sit. The Ambassador, Sir George Staunton, and
Mr. Ellis, sat opposite to the Viceroy, Foo-yuen, and Hop-poo
respectively. The viceroy, by a previous arrangement, had
voluntarily ceded the place of honour to the Ambassador, on the left hand
side of the apartment.


The Viceroy, whose lowering brow and gloomy visage strongly
expressed his character of cunning and his feeling of mortified pride,
had-endeavoured on first meeting His Excellency, to assume an
overbearing port, but he grew pale, and his eye sunk under the stern
and steady gaze of the English Ambassador. He in vain endeavourd
to regain his self-possession on his way from the temple, by
outwalking His Excellency, and thus obtaining the appearance of superior
rank in the eyes of the Chinese; and was again disappointed. During
the conference he once more attempted to make good his
pretensions, by assuming an arrogant tone and insinuating an offensive
remark respecting the high privileges enjoyed by the English in
China, and their sole dependence on commerce; but this was the
expiring struggle of self-importance. The Ambassador having in a
decided manner replied that the intercourse between the two
countries was equally advantageous to both, he altered his tone, and
confined himself to unobjectionable subjects : that he might not recur
to others, the Ambassador speedily broke up the conference. On
leaving the building in which it had been held, the Viceroy pointed
to a large collection of fruit and sweetmeats spread in an opposite tent.
as an imperial present to the commissioners. His Excellency requested
that the Emperor might be thanked, and returned to his residence.


The contents of the Emperor's letter to the Prince Regent formed
a subject of much speculation with the Embassy. There was every
reason to expect, judging from the imperial edicts which we had
seen in different parts of our route and since our arrival at Canton,
that it would give a very false and distorted account of all the
transactions of the Embassy. It contained in fact, several unblushing
<!-- Leaf 261 -->
  
  STREETS OF CANTON. gj j

falsehoods; amongst others, the assertions that Lord Macartney had
performed the ceremony of prostration, and that Lord Amherst had
promised to do so, but afterwards refused. We felt no regret in
learning that with a government so faithless, the delivery of the letter
had terminated the Ambassador's official intercourse.


The Embassy employed themselves during the short time they
remained at Canton, in visiting its numerous streets and examining the
various specimens of ingenuity there displayed in a profusion and
excellence no where else to be found in China. A stranger having no
other intercourse Avith the country than through the medium of Canton,
would be led to form an inaccurate judgment both of the general
ingenuity and luxury of its inhabitants. In looking at the different
works in ivory, tortoise-shell, and lacquer, so minutely wrought
that great time must have been expended in working them; and
seeing them of forms not less calculated for utility than decoration,
he might suppose that the interior of Chinese houses would realise
the visionary tales of eastern authors. But if he had passed through
a considerable portion of the empire, he would conclude, that the
accumulation of the beautiful objects that adorn the shops of Canton,
must depend upon some cause quite unconnected with the common
habits of the people: he would in fact find, on a close inspection,
that they are in a large proportion formed on European models.
Except in the houses of the Hong merchants, and these formed no
wide exception to the rule, we always found Chinese dwellings more
remarkable for the simplicity of their interior decoration than any
other character.


I have before had occasion to mention that the fans in use amongst
the Chinese within our observation, were made of the rudest
materials, and I might make the same remark respecting most other
articles of Chinese manufacture so much admired in this country.
At Kang-cho-foo, a city famed for its lacquered ware, we had hastened
into its streets in the hope of purchasing some specimens of its
manufacture, but although we found them in considerable abundance,
could no where discover any that were worth our notice. ThemanuE E 2
<!-- Leaf 262, Page: 212 -->
facture indeed seemed to be confined to utensils of wood, not better
varnished than the common tea chests sent to this country.


I have already had occasion to mention the skill of the Chinese in
cutting the hardest stones, in describing a vase of exquisite
workmanship which I found in a shop at Tien-sing. At Canton I had an
opportunity of ascertaining their capability of hollowing them, in a
manner quite enigmatical to European workmen. Of these the snuff
bottles of rock. crystal and of agate were amongst the most puzzling/
I have one of each of these now before me, Avhich, through openings
in their neck not the fourth of an inch in diameter, have been worked
into the perfect holloAvs of glass smelling bottles.


The Chinese possess a peculiar facility for cutting stone, in the
large quantities of adamantine spar or corundum which are found in
their shops, and which came, they said, from the neighbourhood
of Canton. That they have it near at hand and of easy access, is
probable from its profusion, and the low price at which they sell it.
For a Spanish dollar I obtained as much as I chose to accept. The
only opportunity that I obtained of seeing it used was in the
manufacture of lenses made for spectacles, and which are formed from rock
crystal, with the assistance of powdered corundum, and a bow with a
steel thread. The workman fixes a mass of the crystal, Avhich he has
previously worked into a cylindrical form, over a small trough of
water firmly before him; and having besmeared the surface of it with
the powdered corundum made into a paste with water, cuts it into
laminæ by the continued action of the bow, which he assists by
adding fresh portions of the corundum paste, and moistening the
crystal Avith water from the trough. The rough segments thus
obtained are afterwards ground into lenses of different degrees of
convexity, but according to no certain rule.


In the shops of porcelain at Canton, in all respects inferior to those
we had seen at Nan-chang-foo, I in vain endeavoured to obtain the
materials used in its composition. I had no reason however to
suppose that the corundum, as has been suspected, is one of them. Of
the other ingredients, the kaolin is well known to be the porcelain
<!-- Leaf 263, Page: 213 -->
earth of other countries, but the petuntse has not been so well
ascertained. The late Sir George Staunton described it as a species of
granite, in which quartz seemed to bear the largest proportion.
I am rather inclined to think, that pure quartz alone is the petuntse
of the Chinese, from having, when off Hong-kong, seen boats laden
with quartz evidently taken from veins which abounded in the
neighbouring granite rocks.


Although more fortunate in obtaining the minerals said to be
employed in colouring the porcelain, I have no other observation to
make respecting them, than that their names did not accord with
their colours, proving that they undergo some modification before
they are applied to the porcelain, or whilst they are exposed to the
heat of the furnace. It Avas not without repeated assurances that I
had no intention of establishing a porcelain manufactory in my own
country, that I was enabled to procure them from their vender at a
considerable price.


Glass shops abound in the streets of Canton, but are chiefly filled
with European goods, excepting only those of the mirror makers.
All the looking-glasses that Ave saw in China Avere remarkable for the
extreme thinness of the plate, which was scarcely thicker than
common writing paper, but was coated with an amalgam in the manner
of our OAvn. According to the Missionaries, the Chinese have for
ages possessed the art of glass making; but if this be the fact, it is
singular that they should derive no advantage from it; and whilst
they set a very high price on all glass articles, make none but from
the glass which they obtain from Europeans and re-melt. Till we
arrived in the province of Canton, excepting small mirrors and a few
baubles, we had met with no glass throughout the empire.


The drug shops in Canton were as numerous as in other cities
of China, but did not enable me to obtain much information
respecting the pharmacy of the country: they contained an innumerable
list of simples, a feAv gums, and some minerals. Many of the first
are sold in small packets; each packet containing a dose or certain  
  
  
  * e e 3
<!-- Leaf 264, Page: 214 -->
number of doses, enveloped in a wrapper describing the qualities of
the medicine and the mode of administering it. Of the gums I could
only make out the camphor. This substance, as exposed for sale at.
Canton, was in very small fragments about the size of a pea, and
seemed to have been picked out from the interior of the plant, and
no doubt came from Borneo or Sumatra.* It is not f procured
from the same plant as the Chinese camphor, and, there is some
reason to believe, is of a more volatile nature, and possesses more
powerful properties. The Chinese physicians are so persuaded of
this, that although the most ordinary kind costs them four hundred
taels, or upwards of one hundred and thirty pounds the piccul,
they prescribe it in preference to their own, the best of Avhich is
exported for twenty-eight taels, or less than ten pounds the piccul.


The Chinese employ camphor largely in a great number of
diseases, and to free themselves from vermin, to which 1 but too well
know, from my own experience, that the Chinese are remarkably
subject. A very common amusement amongst our boatmen was in
searching for them in their clothes, and cracking them between
their teeth.


No opium is exposed for sale in the shops, probably because it is
a contraband article, but it is used with tobacco in all parts of the
empire. The Chinese indeed consider the smoking of opium as one


* The plant whence the Borneo or Sumatra camphor is procured has been described
and figured in the twelfth volume of the Asiatic Transactions, by Mr. H. T. Colebroke,
under the name of Dryabalanops Camphora.


f The mode of procuring the Borneo camphor is thus related by Mr. Marsden. " The
tree, when cut down, is divided transversely into several blocks, and these again are split
with wedges into small pieces, from the interstices of which the camphor, if any there be,
is extracted. That which comes away readily in large flakes, almost transparent, is
esteemed the prime sort or head; the smaller clean pieces arc considered as belly; and
the minute particles, chiefly scraped from the wood and often mixed with it, are called
foot, according to the customary terms adopted in the assortment of drugs. The mode of
separating it from these and other impurities, is by steeping and washing it in water, and
sometimes with the aid of soap." History of Sumatra, p. 150.
<!-- Leaf 265, Page: 215 -->
of the greatest luxuries; and if they are temperate in drinking, they
are often excessive in the use of this drug. They have more than
one method of smoking it: sometimes they envelope a piece of
the solid gum in tobacco, and smoke it from a pipe with a very
small bowl; and sometimes they steep fine tobacco in a strong solution
of it, and use it in the same Avay. The smokers of opium have a very
peculiar, sottish, and sleepy physiognomy, in consequence of the
whole visage being turgid with blood. They may acquire this
from their mode of inhaling its smoke, of which they seldom take
more than three or four whiffs. Having lighted their pipes, they
draw into their lungs as large a volume of smoke as possible, and
having held their breath for a few seconds, throw it gradually forth
through their nose, mouth, and ears, so as strongly to impress these
organs of sense. They then fall into a sort of torpor and continue
in it for several minutes, and much longer when they can command
time for its indulgence.


Tobacco is every where sold, and is considered by the Chinese,
next to tea, as the best preservative of health, and is therefore
universally used by all ranks : I never saw a Chinese without his pipe.
It is used in very different states in different provinces, and has very
different degrees of strength, depending in some measure perhaps
on the difference of soil and climate where it is cultivated. In the
province of Pe-tchee-lee, and probably in all the northern provinces,
it is very mild, but in the south it has much more powerful
qualities. These different properties may also depend on the various
modes of preparing it. In the province of Pe-tchee-lee it is of a pale
colour, and undergoes no other preparation than that of drying, and
is sold in the whole leaf to the purchaser, who reduces it to a
coarse powder, by rubbing it between the hands before using it.
After entering the province of Kiang-nan it was always found of a
red colour, and cut into exceedingly fine shreds; but was said to
owe its colour to steeping in a solution of opium. We saw the
mode of cutting this variety of tobacco in several places.
Considerable quantities of its leaves having been acted upon by a powerful
<!-- Leaf 266, Page: 216 -->
press, and thus formed into a compact mass, are cut by a plane into
small shreds.


From the mineral kingdom the Chinese appear to draw some
remedies, and especially mercury, which they employ in several forms,
and in the diseases for which its specific powers are used in other
countries. They employ some of its oxides and its muriate
externally in cutaneous diseases; and a very beautiful preparation,
consisting of fine flakes, of a pearly white colour, internally in chronic
disorders; but fumigate with the sulphuret of mercury Avhen they
wish to produce its most powerful effects. To Mr. Pearson's Paper,
in the ninth volume of the Annals of Philosophy, I may refer my
readers for further information on this subject. It is
especiallycurious, as affording illustrations of the complicated and blundering
methods by which the Chinese, in their chemical operations, arrive
at vague results unaided by the slightest glimmering of science.*
Although the Chinese understand the use of mercury they seldom
intentionally exhibit it to the extent of producing salivation, and
consequently often fail in curing complaints for which they prescribe
it. The Hong merchants are so sensible that European practitioners
know its qualities much better than their countrymen, that they
always place themselves under their care in all cases requiring its use.

The practice of medicine of the Chinese is entirely empirical.
Through the kindness of Mr. Manning, who acted as my interpreter,
I had an opportunity of conversing with one of the most respectable
native practitioners of Canton, and found him entirely destitute of
anatomical knowledge. He was aAvare of the existence of such


* The following is a preparation of mercury peculiar to the Chinese: «'On cboisit

<!-- Leaf 267, Page: 217 -->
viscera as the heart, lungs, liver, spleen, and kidneys, but had no
notion of their real situation, and through some strange perversity
placed them all on the wrong side of the body. This man was not,
hoAvever, ignorant through choice, for he viewed with much
eao-erness and Avith an evident anxiety for information, some of the
anatomical plates of the Encyclopædia Britannica, Avhich I procured
from the library of the Factory; and he Avith much apparent
sincerity told Mr. Manning, that good anatomical plates on a large scale
Avould be the most Araluable present that could be conferred on his
country. Although ignorant of all rational principles of practice,
he had arrived through his own experience, or that of others, at some
rules of high utility; making a very clear distinction between
those local diseases which can be cured by mere topical
applications, and those which can only be acted upon through the medium
of the constitution. He had some vague notions of a humoral
pathology, which he seemed to have perpetually in his mind Avhilst
answering my different questions; talked of ulcers being outlets to
noxious matter; and divided both his diseases and remedies into
two classes, the hot and cold. The difficulty of our intercourse,
arising from the impossibility of finding adequate terms in the
Chinese lano-uacce for medical phrases, prevented my obtaining much
accurate information respecting the details of his practice. The
only general fact at which I could arrive respecting it, was, that he
depended greatly on purgatives for driving out the " heat of the
body," and for producing a favourable change on local disorders.

I endeavoured to obtain some facts from my informer respecting

the use of the moxa or actual cautery amongst the Chinese; and
found that he considered its application as one of the most effectual
remedies for local pain. The moxa is prepared by bruising the stems
of a species of Artemesia in a mortar, and selecting the finest and
most downy fibres. In this state it is applied in small conical masses
upon the part affected; the number being proportioned to the extent
or severity of the disease. These being set on fire, instantly
consume, Avithout, as the physician assured me, producing any severe  
  
  
  F F
<!-- Leaf 268, Page: 218 -->
pain. From his ignorance of anatomy I could not learn whether the
moxa be used amongst the Chinese in any cases of enlarged viscus;
but I have no doubt, from his unqualified statement, " that it is
applied in all cases of local pain," that it is resorted to in liver or
any other internal diseases, when expressed by external uneasiness.
That it is applied in affections of the head I had sufficient evidence,
in the number of Chinese whom I saw in different parts of the
country, having on their foreheads small round escars, bearing every
appearance of having been produced by the action of fire. My
informer took great pains to persuade me of the general success of the
remedy. To act upon the imagination as well as the body, it is
asserted that the part to which the moxa is to be applied is often
first pricked with gold pins, and that itinerant practitioners in the
north of China, fire it with much ceremony by the assistance of a
convex mirror of ice.*


The fibre of the artemesia is also used by the Chinese as tinder,
after previously steeping it in a solution of nitre; and is carried by
them in small pouches suspended from their girdles, by the side of
their pipes.


The small pox, which for centuries has at different periods made
dreadful havock all over the empire, is likely soon to be extirpated
by the benign influence of vaccination establishing under the auspices
of Mr. Pierson, the principal surgeon of the British factory. The
first attempts of that gentleman to introduce it were pertinaciously
opposed; but through his active and persevering humanity, aided by
a small publication in the Chinese language by Sir George Staunton
and himself, pointing out its peculiar safety, and the security Avhich
it gives against the small pox, it has obtained the sanction of the local
government of Canton, and the strenuous support of the Hon"
merchants. Native vaccinators have been appointed and educated
under the eye of Mr. Pierson, and are taking from him the labour


* On fait geler de l'eau dans un vase rond et convexe; la glace presentee au soleil en
reunit les rayons et allume l'armoise." Memoires concernant les Chinois, torn v. p. 517.
<!-- Leaf 269, Page: 219 -->
of inoculating the lowest class of Chinese. I witnessed their
operations, in a temple near the British factory, on some of the children of
the hundreds of anxious parents who flocked to procure the
preservation of their offspring from the small pox, at that time preA^alent at
Canton. If the paternal government of China can free itself from
national prejudices, it will erect a monument of gratitude to the
discovery of Jenner, and the services of Pierson.


In the shops of Canton, and of many cities of China, we saw
such large quantities of striated gypsum, as proved its very
extensive use. I Avas neither fortunate enough to obtain anv information
respecting the places whence it is procured, or the purposes to
which it is applied. I am disposed to believe, that after having
been deprived of its water of crystallization by heat, and thus
reduced to mere plaster of Paris, it is used in the composition of a
cement for stopping the leaks of boats. A cement, of a white
colour, was exposed for sale in shops, and applied to the leaks of our
own boats; and as it was used under circumstances in which it was
necessary at once to keep out the Avater, it was probably a substance
that very speedily hardened.


The gypsum has been supposed to be used as an antidote to
the effects of mercury, but as this remedy is very rarely given to
the extent of producing salivation, it is not perhaps very likely to be
administered Avith this view.


Our rambles in the streets of Canton were entirely confined to
the suburbs; the city itself being as inaccessible to the curiosity
of the Embassy as it is at all times to the members of the
British factory. One of the gentlemen not being quite satisfied that
it was impossible to enter it, and finding himself one day
unexpectedly before its gates, ventured to pass them; but had not
advanced far when he was followed by a Chinese, who ran after him,
holding in his hand an areca nut, arid urging him to return to his
stall to make some purchase; taking him at the same time so forcibly
by the arm, that his obeying him was scarcely voluntary. Having
reached the stall, he endeavoured to satisfy the man that he had  
  
  
  ff 2
<!-- Leaf 270, Page: 220 -->
no wish to buy any thing, and again left him in the hopes of
penetrating into the city. But the Chinese followed him a second
time, and seizing his arm still more roughly, led him in a very
determined manner, but with an air of mock politeness, to the outside
of the gate. It afterwards appeared, that a police officer, in the
character of a salesman, had been posted at the gate for the purpose
of intercepting any strangers who might attempt to enter the city.


Satisfied with exploring the suburbs of Canton, the Embassy were
desirous of turning their steps to the surrounding country; but this
was also prohibited ground, excepting the nursery gardens at Fa-tee,
situated on the southern bank of the river about three miles from
Canton. The reputed richness of these gardens in rare and
beautiful plants raised our expectations, and did not lead entirely to
their disappointment. Plants remarkable for their dazzling colours
and singular forms were, however, more cultivated than those of
great rarity. The Mou-tan or peony tree, Azalias, Camellias, the
Vaccinium formosa, roses, and a great variety of orange plants in full fruit,
were the most general. The mou-tan, also called fa-wang or king
of flowers, on account of its beauty, and pe-leang-king or hundred
ounces of gold, on account of the enormous price given for it by
the curious, was not in flower when I saw it. I could not therefore
judge, from my own observation, of the fidelity of those Chinese
drawings which represent this plant with yelloAV flowers, and was
unable to meet with any person at Canton who had either seen or
believed it to exist. The mou-tan is said never to survive more than
three years at Canton or Macao: all the plants of it which I saw
were very young.


Of the double flowered Camellia Japonica*, the varieties were
numerous; but in no respect different to those that are seen in this


* I have no doubt that this plant is often confounded with the full flowered Camellia
oleifera, and that the latter is often sent to this country and cultivated for the former.
The Camellia oleifera may be distinguished from the Camellia Japonica by its more
silkycalyx, and still more decidedly by its leaves being veinless beneath.
<!-- Leaf 271, Page: 221 -->
country. They are cultivated in such profusion at Canton, that
their petals are sometimes used at feasts to strew upon the table, so
as perfectly to cover every part unoccupied by dishes.


The Azalias exhibited no striking varieties of colour, being either
Avhite or red, of different degrees of intensity; but were certainly
the most beautiful plants that I met Avith in China. A very large
specimen which 1 had on board the Alceste bearing blossoms of a
light red, was in such profuse flower the day before the wreck, that
its leaves Avere literally hidden.


The Vactiniumformosa is a sacred plant; its flowers are gathered
at the commencement of the Chinese neAv year, and placed in all
the temples as an acceptable offering to the gods.


The Lycopodium, which I had met with on the tops of barren
hills in the province of Canton, growing to the height of four
or five inches, and which might perhaps be best compared to a
firtree in miniature, was to my surprise cultivated in pots kept in a
tub filled with water; for it had always been found in very arid
situations.


Almost all the dwarf plants seen in the gardens were elms, twisted
into grotesque shapes. One of the principal methods of checking
their growth, and giving them the appearance of age, appeared to
consist, in taking up a young plant and putting it into a pot too
small to allow the spreading of its roots, thereby depriving it of
the means of vigorous growth; and by afterwards wounding the
bark in different places, so as to cover it Avith scars which might
seem to be the consequence of decay; and by tying the branches to
each other, and giving them all kinds of curves.


Besides the plants already mentioned, I here saw the different
varieties of the tea plant, of which it has often been asked me
since my return, whether there be more than one species. This
question I have not been able satisfactorily to answer, although I
had little doubt, Avhen examining the different plants, that there
were two species; but I could not at the time define their characters,
and have since lost the specimens through which I had expected to
<!-- Leaf 272, Page: 222 -->
establish them. It may, however, be remarked, that the plants which
had been brought from the black and green tea districts, differed in
the form, colour, and texture of their leaves; those of the green tea
plant being longer, thinner, and of a lighter colour than those of the
black, although groAving in the same soil: this difference of character
I also observed in a large tea plantation near Macao.


I could gain no information in China inducing me to believe that
the process there used in manufacturing the leaf differs materially
from that employed in Rio Janeiro, and which appears to be nearly
the same as that of Japan, described by Kæmfer. From persons
perfectly conversant with the Chinese method, I learnt that either
of the two plants will afford the black or green tea of the shops;
but that the broad thin-leaved plant is preferred for making the
green tea. As the colour and quality of the tea does not then
depend upon the difference of species, it must arise from some
peculiarity in the mode of manufacturing them. Drying the leaves
of the green tea in vessels of copper has been supposed, but
apparently Avithout foundation, to account for the difference in colour.
Without going into the supposition that any thing extraneous
or deleterious is used, both difference of colour and quality may
perhaps be explained, by considering one of the known
circumstances attending its preparation; namely, the due management of
the heat used in drying the plant. There can be little doubt, that
a leaf dried at a low heat Avill retain more of its original colour and
more of its peculiar qualities than one that has suffered a hio*h
temperature. Supposing, therefore, the leaves of the same species
or variety of the tea plant to have undergone such different degrees
of heat in their preparation, their peculiar properties would be
expected to occur of greatest strength in those of the greenest
colour; or in those to which both Chinese and Europeans attribute
the most powerful properties. I may here add, that by far the
strongest tea which I tasted in China, called " Yu-tien," and used on
occasions of ceremony, scarcely coloured the water. On examinino*
<!-- Leaf 273, Page: 223 -->
it with a view to ascertain the form of the leaves, I found it to
consist of the scarcely expanded buds of the plant.


The question whether the tea plant will thrive in any other
country than China, has in a great measure been settled by the
success of the tea plantations at Rio under very little encouragement.
It may be worth, hoAvever, considering what are the countries in
which it is most likely to succeed, from their relation to its natural
places of growth. The green tea district in the province of
Keangnan is embraced betAveen the twenty-ninth and thirty-first degrees of
north latitude, and is situated at the north-Avestern base of a rido*e of
mountains Avhich divides the provinces of Che-keang and
Keangnan. The black tea district, in the province of Fokien, is contained
within the twenty-seventh and twenty-eighth degrees of north
latitude, and is situated on the south eastern declivities of a ridge
of mountains dividing the province of Fokien from that of Keang-si.
Thus the Avhole range of the great tea districts of China, from the
lowest to the highest degree of latitude, is from twenty-seven to
thirty-one. But although these are the two districts from which
the tea consumed in Europe is derived, the plant also flourishes in
much higher latitudes. According to the Missionaries, it thrives in
the more northern provinces of China; and from Kæmfer it would
appear, that it is cultivated in Japan as far as forty-five north
latitude. All the known habitats of this plant are consequently
within the temperate zone. Looking then to the latitudes in which
the tea is cultivated with success, and especially to those of the
great black and green tea districts, the Cape of Good Hope would
seem to be the most eligible geographical situation for its culture;
and perhaps would be also found the most favourable with respect to
soil.


It appears, from every account given of the tea plant, that it
succeeds best on the sides of mountains, where there can be but little
accumulation of vegetable mould. Our opportunities of seeing its
cultivation were few, but were all in favour of this conclusion. Its
plantations were always at some elevation above the plains, in a
<!-- Leaf 274, Page: 224 -->
kind of gravelly soil formed in some places by disintegrated
sandstone, and in others by the debris of primitive rocks. A large
and flourishing plantation of all the varieties of the plant brought
together by Mr. Ball, the principal tea inspector at Canton, is situated
on& an island close to Macao in a loose gravelly soil, formed by
the disintegration of large-grained granite. Judging from specimens
collected in our route through the province of Keang-nan, whence
the green tea is procured, its rocks consist chiefly of sandstone,
schistus, and granite. As to what may be the exact nature of the
rocks of the black tea country in the province of Fokien, I have no
precise information. But as the great ridge separating that province
from Keang-si is a continuation of the one dividing the latter from
Canton, it is perhaps legitimate to conclude, that their constituent
rocks are the same; and that the hills and soil on the eastern are
the same as we found them on the western side of the ridge, or
that they are covered by a soil like that in which the Camellia
flourishes. If this reasoning be just, the land forming the Cape being
composed of the same class of rocks, namely, granite, schistus,
and sand-stone, and of the same kind of soil that constitute the tea
districts of China, would be scarcely less favourable Avith regard to
structure than geographical situation for the culture of the tea plant.


But although the tea plant might for these reasons succeed better
at the Cape than in many of our other dependencies, the success of the
American plantations proves that it will assuredly flourish on the verge
of the tropics. That it will also grow vigorously within them, is
sufficiently evinced by the fine plants which thrive in Sir Hudson
Lowe's garden at St. Helena. But in both these situations, it
seldom experiences a very high temperature. * In Rio Janeiro the
botanic garden is situated near the sea-shore, and receives the full  
  
  
  influence of the land and sea breezes which blow durino* the greater
part of the twenty-four hours. On the hills of St. Helena, freshened  
  
  
  by the trade winds, the thermometer ranges from sixty-four to
seventy-six degrees. The principal circumstances therefore to be
kept in view in cultivating the tea plant are to obtain for it a
<!-- Leaf 275, Page: 225 -->
meagre soil and a moderate temperature; and these may always
be found on the mountains of tropical islands, and on the inland
hills of temperate continents.


With respect to the management of the plant whilst growing,
and the gathering of its leaves, there is not, I apprehend, much that
is necessary to be learnt. From the general statement of authors it
appears, that after the seed is once committed to a favourable soil,
little subsequent attention is required. A few plantations of
green tea, seen by the Embassy in Keang-nan, consisted of very low
plants, perhaps kept down by pruning; as the Missionaries tell us
that the plant of the green tea districts is never allowed to grow
to a large size; but that in the black tea country it is suffered to attain
its full height, Avhich sometimes reaches to ten or twelve feet. In
collecting the leaves the principal circumstances that seem
necessary to be attended to are, to gather them at the proper seasons,
to select the young leaves for the superior kind of tea, and the older
leaves for that of inferior quality. The many varieties of tea seen
in this country are doubtless the produce of the mixture of teas of
different qualities, after their arrival in England.


But granting that the preparation of tea is more complicated than
there is reason to suppose, it might doubtless be obtained from the
proprietors of tea plantations who frequent Canton during the tea
sales; and is perhaps even now in the possession of many Europeans.
If ever it shall suit the policy of this country to derive the tea
from any of our own dependencies, there can be no doubt that
we shall cease to be indebted to China for an article that enters so
essentially into the comforts of all classes of my countrymen. I have
heard much of the difficulty of transporting plants from China, in
sufficient numbers, and in such health as to give a fair chance to
any experiment for their cultivation; but cannot imagine Avhere that
difficulty lies. A great number of plants which were on board the
Alceste for the purpose of being left at the Cape and at St. Helena,
were in the most vigorous state the day previous to the wreck, and  
  
  
  G G
<!-- Leaf 276, Page: 226 -->
there can be no doubt would have arrived thus at their places of
destination.


Whether the leaves of many other plants would not attain the
same quality as the tea, if submitted to the same process, is at
least doubtful. Du Haide has remarked, that all the plants called
Cha or Tea by the Chinese, are not to be considered as the tea
plant; and states, that a vegetable preparation sold in Shan-tung
as very superior tea, is only a species of moss common to the
mountains of that province. That the Chinese drink an infusion
of ferns as tea is certain, as these plants were sold for the
express purpose at Nan-chang-foo on the Po-yang lake. I cannot
help suspecting that they employ the leaves of the Camellia in
the same way. This plant bears the same name as the tea with
the Chinese, and resembles it in most of its botanical characters,
grows with it in the same district, and is I suspect cultivated in the
same manner: the seeds of both produce oil. Kæmfer informs us, that
a species of Camellia is used in Japan to give a high flavour to tea.


Whatever observations I have made relative to the probability of
the successful cultivation of the tea plant, equally applies to the
Camellia oleifera, or oil plant. I cannot but believe, from what I
have observed of the soil and climate of St. Helena, that many
of its present barren hills might be covered with this elegant and
valuable shrub.


The time unoccupied by the Embassy in visiting the streets of
Canton and the neighbouring gardens, Avas in some measure spent
in exploring the intricacies of the temple in which they resided, and
in witnessing the religious rites of the bonzes. It was only during
our residence at Canton that we had any opportunity of seeing these
on a great scale.


The large religious establishment, of which we inhabited a part, to
the exclusion of numberless deities, almost equalled a town in extent.
Temples with dormitories annexed and other buildings for the
accommodation of bonzes, and ornamented exteriorly with all the
<!-- Leaf 277, Page: 227 -->
tawdriness that perverted taste could suggest, and containing a host of
gilded idols, were distributed over an extensive piece of ground. The
different apartments occupied by the Embassy, had been the temples
of minor deities and the dwellings of their priests; and
communicated with each other by long and narrow passages. These were
intricate and mysterious, and often terminated in small enclosed yards,
intended for no purpose that courted the face of day; or suddenly
opened into squares decorated with a profusion of gay and fragrant
flowers. The imagination suggested that fear and pleasure were
equally used by the ministers of superstition to operate on the
minds of its deluded votaries. On leaving this labyrinth we passed
a number of edifices, some open in front, others closed, and all
containing idols of various degrees of dignity and influence. To
describe their different forms, or to give their several appellations,
would not only exceed the limits and objects of this work, but be
a waste of time and labour, of which the Missionaries seem to have
been little sensible in their elaborate accounts of the minute
subdivisions of the religion of Fo. I may leave my readers to imagine
the endless sects that must have divided a religion, of which the
founder took the following doctrine as its basis : " There is no other
principle of all things but a vacuum and nothing; from nothing have
all things sprung, to nothing they must again return, and there all
our hopes end." *


Four hideous monsters " in form and gesture proudly eminent,"
occupied, two on the right hand and two on the left, the entrance
to an avenue leading from the precincts of the principal temple.
Colossal height and proportions, corpulency, the Chinese
physiognomy caricatured, profuse gilding, green and red paint, were their
leading characters. Incense was burning at all hours of the day on
an altar before them. A miserable devotee, generally a female,
was often seen deprecating their wrath or soliciting their favour.  
  
  
  * Grosier, vol. ii. p. 219.
G G 2
<!-- Leaf 278, Page: 228 -->
On these occasions a taper was lighted at the foot of the idol, and
a priest attended to direct the ceremony. Rice for consecration,
and a painting of some image on paper as an offering, seemed to
be necessary to its due performance. The bonze having received
these, and placed the rice on the altar, lighted the painting by the
taper, and put it in an earthen vessel standing on the ground, to
consume: this vessel was the common receptacle for the ashes of
all such offerings. The supplicant now received from him two
pieces of wood in shape like a kidney, which she suffered to fall
repeatedly from her hand, ejaculating at the same time with much
fervour, and lifting up her eyes to the idol. When she had
finished the bonze took some ashes from the incense vessel, and
having mixed them with the rice, gave her the consecrated mass, and
thus finished the ceremony.


In the principal building of the establishment, we had an
opportunity of witnessing those rites which, from their general resemblance to
the ceremonies of the Roman Catholic church, gave so much offence
to the early missionaries. They fully justified the exclamation of
Father Premare, that " in no other part of the world has the prince of
darkness so well counterfeited the holy manners of the true church."
The temple was large, of an oblong square in form, and contained
upwards of a hundred idols reputed of various degrees and kinds of
influence. In the centre of its area were a group of superior deities
exalted on a platform some feet from the ground, leaving on all sides
a wide aisle between it and the walls of the building. Along these
were arranged the minor deities, or more properly speaking deified
men. Vessels of incense stood on altars before all the principal idols.
In their vicinity were gongs, drums, a hollow instrument of wood,
in from resembling a human skull, and many other musical
instruments. Mats were strewn around for the convenience of the
worshippers.


Summoned at different hours of the day and night by the tolling of
a bell, the bonzes repaired to this temple to perform their devotions.
One of the chief ceremonies commenced about four o'clock in the
<!-- Leaf 279, Page: 229 -->
afternoon. At this hour bare-headed bonzes, clothed in long cloaks
descending to their ancles, some of a yellow, and others of a dark
brown colour, were seen issuing from all the surrounding buildings.
Over these they wore a kind of scarf that crossed their left shoulders,
and was fastened by an ivory ring under the right arm; and
some of them had on their left breasts pieces of white copper which
might have been taken for orders of knighthood. Having entered
the temple, they all, excepting one of the principal priests, knelt
around the idols. He began the ceremony by lighting a sandal-wood
match at a taper that was burning on the altar; and having prayed
Avith it in his hand for a few seconds, carried it to the door of the
temple, and fixed it in a small post that stood without. Returning to
the altar, he took up a small vessel containing rice, and having also
prayed over it, carried it to the door, and placed it before the burning
match. He then consecrated a cup of sam-tchoo in the same
manner, and placed it by the side of the rice; again knelt before
them, and having prayed for some minutes, emptied both cups
upon the altar, and rejoined his brethren. During the consecration,
the Avhole company of bonzes chaunted in measured time, and
appeared to be regulated in their pauses by a man who every now
and then struck the Avooden head occasioning a ringing sound.
Having continued on their knees for some time, they suddenly arose,
and forming into tAvo lines marched chaunting several times round
the temple, and then dispersed.


Near the temple was a library of religious books, containing the
doctrines of Fo, descriptions of local ceremonial observances, and
figures of the idols in very correct outline; and attached to the library
was an office in which they Avere printed. Nothing could be more
simple than the method of printing which I saw practised. On a
piece of Avood about two feet square, carved into the necessary
characters, and covered with ink, a thin paper was laid, which having
been pressed down by the hand, received the desired impression.
The use of moveable types in wood is confined to the printing of
the Pekin Gazette and a few other periodical works. All others are
<!-- Leaf 280, Page: 230 -->
printed in stereotype. The use of moveable metallic types may
perhaps, at no distant period, become general in the empire, as a
manufactory of them in block tin is already established at Macao for
the use of the British factory. The casters and cutters are Chinese,
who execute their work with great precision and despatch.


About ten o'clock on the morning of the twentieth of January, His
Excellency, accompanied by his suite, embarked in his barge; and,
attended by the boats of the Alceste and Lyra and of the other
British ships then lying at Whampoa, took leave of the city of
Canton.


The Viceroy's curiosity induced him to station himself in his
yacht near the spot where he expected they would pass, for the sake
of witnessing the procession; but finding the boats taking a
direction not likely to give him an opportunity of effecting his purpose,
sent his card to the Ambassador requesting him to steer nearer
to his yacht. His Lordship returned the card and directed Captain
Maxwell to continue his course.


About four o'clock the Embassy reached the Alceste, and early
the following morning got under weigh, and passing the batteries
at the mouth of the river received their successive salutes.


As we passed down the river, a large number of pigs, which formed
part of some imperial supplies to the ships, died and were thrown
overboard, proving rich prizes to many Chinese, who in small
boats attended the ship to pick up any animal or vegetable matter
that might be ejected from them. On obtaining a carcase they
immediately cut it up, washed and salted it, and no doubt sold it to
other European ships as prime meat; not because they disliked
such food, for no disease disqualifies the carcase of an animal for the
butchers' shambles in China, but because they considered the entrails
delicious fare.


The Chinese are less fastidious than perhaps any other people in
the choice of their food, feeding on those animals which amongst
other nations are considered unclean, and upon the parts of animals
which are usually rejected with disgust. They prove indeed that the
<!-- Leaf 281, Page: 231 -->
means of human sustenance are much more numerous and widely
diffused than is commonly supposed. The wealthy, indeed, live
upon food which all over the world would be considered
wholesome and luxurious; and of the kinds of meat consumed by other
nations, like beef the least and pork the most; to these they add
venison, sharks' fins, beche de mer, and birds' nests bought at
enormous prices. The middling classes live chiefly upon rice and on
pork, which we found the best meat in China: horse flesh is eaten
by the Tartars, and is sold in the markets at a higher price than beef.
It has been justly remarked by some writer, that it would be much
more difficult to say what the lower class of Chinese do not, than
what they do eat. Dogs, cats, and rats, are exposed for sale in the
markets, and eaten by those who can afford to purchase other food.
In a shop at Ta-tung the same price, about eighteen-pence, was
asked of one of the Embassy for a pheasant and a cat. In a
country Avhere a dreadful destruction of vegetable food is sometimes
produced by the ravages of locusts, it is fortunate if the inhabitants
can find nourishment in the bodies of their plunderers; and that
such is the case in China, where, according to the statement of
various writers, swarms of locusts in some provinces often eat up
every " green thing," is not improbable, as our boatmen considered
grasshoppers roasted alive a very delicate repast. * The ordinary
nutriment of these people, like that of all the lowest class of Chinese,
was what Adam Smith has fitly called the " nastiest garbage." They
fattened on the blood and entrails of the fowls killed in our boats, and
eagerly seized the vilest offals that could be rejected from a
slaughterhouse; and when these could not be obtained, ate rice or millet,
seasoned with a preparation of putrid fish that sent forth a stench quite  
  
  
  * The species which they were seen most generally to eat was thc Gry/lus nasuitts.  
  
  
  * G G 4
<!-- Leaf 282, Page: 232 -->
intolerable to European orgahs. The Chinese, as De Guignes has
remarked, are utterly insensible to bad smells.


Before I take leave of China,. I should be glad to state what is
the impression on my mind Avith regard to the natural character
of its people, but find it very difficult to form any conclusion
respecting it, even to my own satisfaction. Persons travelling
in a country in Avhich they are looked upon by the
government as objects of jealousy, and by the people as beings in
all respects inferior to themselves, must have continually to
contend with prejudices likely to defeat their attempts at forming
a correct estimate of the inhabitants. With the higher or better
informed classes of society, for they are essentially the same in China,
we had very little intercourse that Avas not purely official or
ceremonious; and on all these occasions found them so cased in the
armour of form that it Avas impossible to reach their natural
character, or to depend on their information as the simple statement of
matters of fact. My own opportunity of conversing with a man
of rank, I have already had occasion to mention in the course of
this work, and at the same time to point out his proneness to
falsify. He seemed only anxious to please the person he was
conversing with at the time, with very little regard to veracity. Our most
extensive intercourse was with the trading part of the community,
of whom I have little to add to Avhat I haA^e before stated, namely,
that in their dealings Avith the Embassy they generally proved
themselves cheats Avhen their interest did not compel them to be
honest. It is but fair, however, to remark that the principle of
cheating is so legitimated amongst them by the general practice and
toleration of their countrymen, as to be considered rather as a
necessary qualification to the successful practice of their calling, than
as an immoral quality. In some instances, I found the love
of gain curiously contrasted with a ready disposition to give.
Those who had exacted from me with the greatest pertinacity all
they could obtain whilst bargaining with me in their shops, would
<!-- Leaf 283, Page: 233 -->
freely give me their much valued plants that decorated their court
yards. On the banks of the Pei-ho, after purchasing of an itinerant
salesman, under the usual circumstances, some trifling article, I
stopped to examine a well wrought chain apparently of silver,
from which his little apparatus was suspended: he immediately
unfastened, and begged me to accept, and Avas evidently much
mortified at my refusing it.


Of the middling class of people, if such there were distinct from
that of the mercantile, Ave had no opportunity of judging, excepting
as they might form a part of the croAvds which surrounded us. in the
neighbourhood of towns and cities. In these assemblages, an eager
curiosity assimilated the characters of the whole mass.


Amongst the loAvest orders of Chinese abject penury appeared to
have extinguished most of the qualities which distinguish man from
inferior animals, save that of national importance, for even these people
prided themselves on being members of the " celestial empire."


In the peasantry alone, were we likely to find any approach to
what might be called the radical character of the people; and as
far as my experience has gone respecting it, it is all in favour of its
simplicity and amiableness. Before my unlucky illness, I was often
enabled to get amongst them apart from my friends and usual
attendant soldiers, and ahvays found them mild, forbearing, and humane.


Respecting the validity of those general charges of inhumanity
brought against the whole Chinese people, and founded on their
reputed practice of infanticide, and their apathy in withholding
assistance to their countrymen when in danger, my information is
chiefly of a negative kind. It will readily be supposed, that in our
almost linear progress through the empire, we Avere not in the way
of obtaining a sufficient number of facts for estimating the different
degrees of credibility attached to the statements*, according as little


* The late Sir Guorge Staunton estimated the yearly amount of infantile exposures in
the city of Pekin alone at 2000, Mr. Barrow at 9000, and many of the Missionaries still
higher.  
  
  
  o  
  
  
  H H
<!-- Leaf 284, Page: 234 -->
on the subject of infanticide as on that of population, respecting
the causes and extent of the exposure of children in China. But
granting that any of these statements are well founded, it will
scarcely be believed, that, in passing over its populous rivers through
upwards of sixteen hundred miles of country, we should meet with
no proofs of its mere existence; yet such has been the fact, for not
even that very equivocal and variously explained circumstance of
infants supported above water by gourds fastened to their necks*,
fell under our notice, nor indeed any other that could lead to a
belief of its practice. The experience of De Guignes, whom I
have so often quoted, and of whose accuracy we all had frequent
proofs, was of a similar nature. He has had occasion to declare
that in his route through the Avhole extent of China, in travelling
by water he never saw an infant drowned; and in travelling by land,
although he had been early in the morning in cities and villages,
and at all hours on the highways, he never saw an infant exposed
or dead.


* As the different modes of accounting for the fact that children are sometimes found in
China floating in the water, with gourds round their necks to prevent their sinking, afford
an illustration of the difficulty of arriving at precise information respecting infanticide in
China, I subjoin the following quotations: " 11 faut pourtant que nous disions un mot
de ces enfans qu'on jette dans la riviere apres leur avoir lie au dos un courge ouide, de
sorte qu'ils flottent long temps avant d'expirer Ces infortunes enfans sont des
victimes offertes a l'esprit de la riviere, d'apres des oracles, en vertu d'un sort, ou en
executive d'un devouement." Memoires concernant les Chinois, torn. ii. p. 400.


\"Those whose constant residence is upon the water, and whose poverty, or superstition,
or total want of sensibility, or whatever the cause may be, that leads them to the
perpetration of an act against which nature revolts, sometimes, it is said, expose their infants
by throwing them into the canal or river, with a gourd tied round their necks, to keep
the head above water, and preserve them alive until some humane person may be induced
to pull them up." Travels in China, by John Barow, p. 170.


\"Quant a ce que Ton dit qu'elles attachent une calabasse sur le dos des enfans pour les
faire flotter plus long-tems, afin de donner le terns a quelque personne charitable de leur
sauver la vie, elles ne le font que pour avoir elles-memes le moyen de les secourir dans le
cas on les tomberoit a la riviere. J'ai ete temoin d'un pareil accident; la mere loin
d'abandonner son fils a son malheureux sort, ne fut tranquille que lorsque elle le revit dans ses
bras." Voyage a Peking, torn. ii. p. 289.
<!-- Leaf 285, Page: 235 -->

The tales of Chinese infanticide had made me very watchful for
every circumstance that could illustrate the ordinary state of those
feelings that must be violated in its commission; and had certainly
led me to look for a lower degree of parental affection in China
than in other countries. Under this impression I recorded in my
journal many examples of parental tenderness, which now appear
almost too trivial to mention. I may be permitted, however, to
state, that in the multitudes who often assembled about us, I have
repeatedly seen parents in the lowest rank of life expose
themselves to the lashes and insults of the soldiers in defending their
children from the pressure of the crowd; and that whilst I often
witnessed all the acknowledged proofs of the existence of this
principle in its perfection, I on no occasion observed an instance of its
defectiveness.


That infanticide is practised in China, especially in times of
dreadful scarcity, to which, from thenature of the government, and the
corruption of local officers, that country is peculiarly subject, the
concurring testimony of many authors scarcely admits of a doubt;
but that it ever materially affects the amount of population, and
still less that it ever depends on any general want of that divine
and uncontrollable principle which guards the safety of offspring,
the entire absence of all evidence, within our experience, even of
its mere existence, does not allow me to believe. From all that I
was capable of observing, and from all that I was enabled to learn,
I am quite of the opinion expressed by an eloquent writer, " That
when the parent has any possible means of supporting his offspring,
there is no country where maternal affection is stronger than in
China."*


Regarding the alleged indifference of the Chinese to the fate of a
fellow-creature struggling for life, of Avhich Mr. M'Leod has had
occasion to record a frightful instance in his voyage to Lew-chew, but

<!-- Leaf 286, Page: 236 -->
Avho has omitted to mention that he was himself mainly accessary in
preserving the lives of those that were saved; it is but justice to
recollect, whilst we admit the facts, that they occurred in a country
where an ineffectual attempt to save the life of another, under the
slightest shade of suspicion, is followed by the punishment of death.


The Alceste having anchored off Macao on the morning of the
twenty-third, the Ambassador and his suite landed on the same day,
and again experienced the hospitality of the Factory, who gave up
their houses for their accommodation. The Portuguese governor,
like his superiors at Rio Janeiro, abstained from showing the
Ambassador any attention, and for the same alleged reason—the death of
the Queen of Portugal.


The toAvn of Macao offered nothing to our observation that is
Avorthy description. The country in its neighbourhood is full of
rare plants, of which the nepenthes distillatoria is one of the most
singular. The rocks of the neighbouring islands consist of a very
large-grained granite, contain masses of shorl, and are remarkable
for groups of crystals of felspar which often occur separated from the
other constituents.
<!-- Leaf 287, Page: 237 -->
  
  CHAPTER IX.

The Alceste left Macao roads on the evening of the twenty-eighth
of January, and shaping her course for Manilla, made Point Capones
on the second of February; and having beaten into Manilla Bay
during the night, anchored the following day about noon at the
distance of a mile and a half from the town. The Embassy landed the
same afternoon on the northern bank of the river which flows past
Manilla in a suburb opposite the city, and found themselves in the
midst of a crowd occasioned by a procession in honour of the
purification of the Virgin. This festival falls on the preceding day in
our calendar, as the Spaniards of Manilla continue to adopt a
system of reckoning time which the first discoverers of the
Phillippine Isles established.


A scene that presented itself to us on landing produced a
favourable impression on our minds as to the wealth and population
of the colony. A great number of the better classes of both sexes,
chiefly in European dresses, were driving about in open carriages
drawn by sleek and high-mettled ponies bred on the island.
Amongst the pedestrians were many of the inferior clergy,
distinguished by their large cocked hats with long tassels before and behind.
The mass of the crowd was made up of the half casts; of whom,
both men and Avomen were remarkable for their well proportioned
figure and erect gait; the latter especially being tall, very finely shaped,
and having a dignified carriage. Their dress was well adapted to the
climate, and admitted the freest play of their limbs; consisting of
a loose linen tunic, Avhich scarcely reached the cabaya, or
<!-- Leaf 288, Page: 238 -->
embroidered petticoat, wrapped round the waist. Their long black
hair was worn in a knot on the back of the head, or partially
concealed by a transparent handkerchief, of the manufacture of the
country, which was fastened above the forehead and allowed to
flow freely over the back of the head. Their slippers, worked Avith
silver or gold thread, being unconfined to their feet, caused a
kind of sliding walk. The dress of the men consisted of a pair
of pantaloons and a loose shirt, of the cloth of the country, which
descended beloAv the knees, and had a stiff worked collar; and was
rendered unbecoming by a large round straw hat with a very high
and wide crown.


The whole crowd of equestrians and pedestrians Avas pressing
anxiously forward to meet the procession, when the bell of an
adjoining convent proclaimed the hour of sun-set. In a moment
every foot paused, and every sound was hushed. Looking around,
we saw every head uncovered and every person wrapped in silent
prayer. The bell ceased, and all again moved on, and seemed to
resume their interrupted trains of thought. In a few minutes the
flashing of torches announced the approach of the procession. The
image of the Virgin, enthroned in a canopy of flowers mingled with
tinsel, which reflected the light of tapers borne by attendant monks
in robes of white and grey, was the only object which I could
distinctly observe. My imagination went back to the processions
Avhich I had so lately seen in China at funerals and marriage
festivals; and I could not but regret that the ministers of the pure
religion of Christ, and those of the vilest idolatry which disgraces
human nature, should endeavour by like methods to influence the
minds of the people. Turning away, we walked towards the shore;
and on our road partook of some refreshment at a small shop kept
by three Indian girls who seemed not a little surprised at seeing
persons of the apparent rank of their visitors on foot; for in Manilla
a pedestrian of respectability is an uncommon spectacle.  
  
  
  The next morning His Excellency, accompanied by his suite,
<!-- Leaf 289, Page: 239 -->
entered the city of Manilla on a visit to the governor; and having
passed through some long gloomy streets with houses of one story,
lighted by oyster-shell windows, reached the palace. We were
received in a large unfurnished room with unaffected politeness
and a cordial welcome by Don Mariano Fernand es Folgarez the
Governor, Avho proffered us every kind of civility for the time we
should remain at Manilla, and invited all the members of the
Embassy to dine with him next day. On leaving the city, which
appeared strongly fortified, the Embassy passed over a draw-bridge
into the suburbs, impatient to see the inhabitants, of whom they
had caught but an imperfect glimpse the night before. The
mulatto women lost something of their attractions when seen in
open day, not from their appearing less comely, but from their
carrying in their mouths immense cigars. Many of these were seven
or eight inches long, and an inch and a half in diameter; of such
magnitude, indeed, that the mouth seemed scarce large enough to
grasp them. When they Avere fully light, and pouring fourth
volumes of smoke, they might have been taken for chimnies to mar
chines rendered locomotive by the powers of steam.


The manufacture of cigars affords employment to a great number
of native Avomen, and exhibits to the stranger an interesting
example of local customs. It is carried on in a spacious gallery of a
square form. Upwards of two thousand females of all ages are
seated at low tables at which they make cigars by rolling the leaves
of the tobacco plant on each other. The most scrupulous
precaution is taken to prevent their smuggling it in any form.
Superintendants walk round the tables and collect the cigars as they are
made, and examine the persons of the workers at the close of
their labour. This process, for an account of which I am indebted
to Captain Basil Hall who witnessed it, is rather singular. Thirty
women, for the most part elderly, and thought particularly
trustworthy, seat themselves, excepting one, round a circular
landing-place without the entrance to the gallery. One only stands
<!-- Leaf 290, Page: 240 -->
at the door of the gallery with a rattan in her hand, and allows
thirty girls to enter, counting them off as they come in. When the
thirty have passed, they go up to their respective examiners, and
having freed their long black hair, hold it in their hands at arm's
length; they then shake their handkerchiefs and loosen the other
parts of their dress, and suffer the examiners to pass their hands
over their bodies to ascertain if any tobacco be concealed close to
their persons. In this manner successive parties are searched, till
all the girls have undergone the examination. The examiners then
rise, and in the same way examine each other.


The government monopolizes the sale of tobacco, and, to keep
up its price, is said to destroy the extra produce of a very fertile
season.


The suburbs of Manilla are principally composed of houses built,
in the native manner, of matted bamboo for the Avails, and the leaves
of the palm for the roofs, mingled with houses of stone, with churches
and convents. The bamboo dwellings are inhabited by the mulattos,
called mestis, natives and Chinese, all of whom, especially the
mulattos and Chinese, are the tradesmen of the place. None of
them stand very high for honesty, but the Chinese maintain their
character for pre-eminence in cheating. *


The Chinese are charged with various crimes, are watched with
much suspicion by the government, and are as cordially hated by
the natives of Luconia as by the Javanese. They at least have
their share of punishment. Two of them, and a native, were
executed for the crime of murder during our visit at Manilla.
The malefactors were strangled by a method peculiar and frightful.


* It is but justice to make an exception in favour of some of the mulatto women, who
are said to be the chief negociants of Manilla, and yet give no other security fortheir
purchases than their words, for a credit of two years. The author of the Voyage aux
Indes Orientales states, that he has known a mulatto woman furnished with merchandize
to the amount of two hundred thousand dollars, with no other security than a verbal
promise, which she has kept with the utmost fidelity. — Vol. II. p. 347.
<!-- Leaf 291, Page: 241 -->
A frame-work, furnished with a number of iron collars at the height
of the neck of a man of ordinary stature, when sitting, is placed in
the most public square in the suburbs, having in its front a number
of stools of variable elevation, like the music stools of this
country, to raise or depress the culprit. When the unfortunate
wretch is brought to the requisite height, the collar, always much
too small, is put round his neck, and by a screw behind is tightened
with sudden violence. The execution usually takes place in the
morning soon after sun-rise, but the bodies are not removed till sun-set.


In accepting the invitation of the Governor to dinner, the
Embassy had an opportunity of seeing many of the most respectable
of the colonists, and found that the stateliness usually attached to the
Spanish character, entered in no degree into their polite standard
of manners. We sat down at two o'clock to a sumptuous board,
of which the Olla podrida was not the least attractive ornament.
Mirth and temperance presided, although sometimes chequered
with clamour. Two of the party, an Andalusian and Gallician,,.
asserted their respective superiority in the art of salad-making, and
in their loud appeals to the company seemed to use more
earnestness than the occasion merited. One of these gentlemen was
master of the ceremonies wherever he appeared, and seemed well
adapted for managing the gay frivolities of life. He was grand
carver at the Governor's table, and chief beau at the ball; and
whether eating, drinking, or dancing, was pre-eminent in action.
In the discharge of the duties of his official situation, all Manilla
said that he equally excelled; and that he was behind no one in
hospitality to strangers all the Embassy can testify.


Shortly after dinner the party adjourned to another room, and
partook of coffee, tea, and cigars. About five, in conformity with
general custom, they drove out in carriages upon a broad road that
winds round the city. Soon after sun-set they returned to the
Governor's, and were now joined by his two daughters and other ladies,
-all dressed in the European style. The evening concluded with
music and dancing.  
  
  
  i i
<!-- Leaf 292, Page: 242 -->

On the following morning I joined a party of friends on an
excursion to the village of Los Bagnos, on the southern bank of a
celebrated lake called Laguna de Baie. This lake is situated to the east
of Manilla, and is stated to be forty-five leagues in circumference.
Its waters are fresh, and empty themselves into the sea by the river
Passig. This river is navigable at all seasons of the year to very
heavy boats, and flows about twenty miles before it reaches the Bay
of Manilla.


We left Manilla in a felucca provided by the Governor, and which
was rowed by sixteen natives, who used the slow majestic manner of
the Spaniards, rising on their feet at every stroke. The scenery
on each bank of the river was replete with romantic beauties, and
greatly resembled that of Java. Palms and bananas, mingled with
trees of a more umbrageous character, surrounded the Avattled
bamboo huts of the natives, supported on piles some feet from the
ground. They are guarded by this construction against the effects of
inundations which sometimes occur from the overflowing of the
river and lake; but being built entirely of wood, are very liable to
fire, especially as every native keeps it in some shape or other in his
dwelling for lighting his cigar. Widely spreading conflagrations
often occur and consume whole villages in a few hours. A very
singular effect is said to be then produced by the air confined in the
joints of bamboo, becoming expanded by heat, and bursting them
asunder and scattering them in all directions. The same circumstance,
however, which renders them so capable of destruction, makes the
calamity less severe, as a bamboo hut can be erected in a few hours.


When these dwellings were so numerous as to form a village, a
principal building was seen rising above them, sometimes distinguished
by a gothic spire, and sometimes by a crucifix. Gothic spires and
gothic arches, formed of bamboo, are common on the island,
introduced, it might be supposed, by Europeans; but, according to all
accounts, they are purely native, excepting the cross which usually
surmounts them.
<!-- Leaf 293, Page: 243 -->

In our passage up the river, we passed many of the canoes of the
natives formed of the hollowed trunk of a tree, about twenty feet
long, two wide, and one deep. These have sometimes an awning
extending almost the Avhole length of the boat, formed of the
plaited leaves of the palm, supported on six posts; and on the
bottom, an elastic platform of split bamboo, on which passengers
can recline at full length. A very thick entire bamboo always
passes along the outside of the gunwhale, which, offering an increased
surface of great buoyancy to the Avater Avhen the canoe heels over,
prevents its upsetting. These canoes are often shaped like a fish,
having the head and stern carved to represent its head and tail,
and the body rounded to the shape of its belly. They are rowed
by four paddles, and make great way even against a strong current.


On approaching the lake, we found the country low and marshy,
cut by innumerable rivulets, and in many places flooded. Herds of
buffaloes, of a pale blue colour and little hair, with very long curved
horns turned back close to the head, were crossing the river, having
the nose and eyes alone above the water. Little boys, on these
occasions, often stand on the backs of the headmost animals, holding
by a string fastened to their heads, and in guiding them guide the
Avhole herd.


The stream of the river having been strongly against us, we
gained the entrance of the lake too late to reach Los Bagnos that
night, then distant about thirty miles, and therefore directed our
course to the Convent of Benangonan, situated on its bank. The
lake, soon after leaving the river, exhibited an expanse of Avater
which seemed to justify the calculation of its reputed extent. So
great indeed Avas its breadth, that its boundaries Avere very ill
defined, although many of the circumjacent mountains are high.
The surface was covered with Avild fowl too shy to allow our
obtaining any shots. The bamboo nets, or rather fences, used by
the natives for taking fish, Avere very numerous, and must render
its navigation in the dark very dangerous. They are mere
bamboo mats fastened to poles, and placed upright in the water,  
  
  
  i i 2
<!-- Leaf 294, Page: 244 -->
and so united as to form a kind of labyrinth from which the fish,
having once entered, cannot disentangle themselves.


A dark night prevented our seeing the scenery in the
neighbourhood of the convent of Benangonan. We landed on a kind of
pier near a mound of stone, on which Avas erected a huge cross in front
of a court that led to the convent. The guide who accompanied us
having made known to its inmates that we were travelling under the
protection of the Government, obtained for us immediate admittance.
We were received by an Augustine friar, who led us into the
refectory of the convent, and informed us that the Superior was
absent, but would soon return. The convent, like most others in
Luconia, was capable of lodging a great number of monks, but
appeared to contain only two Augustine fathers. Our host, seemingly
about forty years of age, something below the middling height, and
rather corpulent, conversed Avith us in Latin, and finding one of the
party was a medical man, begged his advice for a complaint which
he endeavoured to express by laying his hand on his stomach, and
exclaiming repeatedly, "fames habeo." As his plump figure, ruddy
complexion, and laughing eyes, seemed to forbid the supposition of
real disease, we were disposed to believe that he had some other
object in view than obtaining medical advice. When he found,
however, that "fames habeo" did not render his complaint
intelligible, he went into other symptoms, and when he had obtained a
prescription was satisfied.


In about half an hour after our arrival, the Superior came in. He
was a tall majestic figure, and entering enveloped in his cowl and
leaning on his staff, presented an admirable subject for the pencil.
When freed of his cloak, he exhibited a countenance of intelligence
and feeling. He welcomed us cordially, and immediately gave
directions for our supper and beds. He had been, he said, on a
visit to the Indians of his neighbourhood, some of whom were
dying, and others dangerously ill of an epidemic disease that had
been some time prevalent on the island, and peculiarly fatal to the
natives inhabiting the shores of the lake. One of the alleged
<!-- Leaf 295, Page: 245 -->
causes of the distemper was, a quantity of fish, which had been
thrown upon the shores of the lake by the force of a hurricane, and
had remained till they became putrid. A more probable cause of its
fatality to the natives, was their refusing to use the means
successfully employed by Europeans for its cure. St. Croix indeed states,
that the Laguna de Baie communicates with the volcanoes of some
of the surrounding mountains; and mentions, in proof of his
assertion, that " during the summer of 1808 a great quantity of dead
fish appeared on the surface of the lake, giving to the waters a
fetid odour, and rendering them undrinkable." He adds, that they
folloAved the course of the river Passig in such immense quantities as
almost to fill its bed, and to cause the apprehension of a plague at
Manilla; and supposes their mortality to have been the consequence
of the water having been strongly impregnated with sulphur.*


Whilst conversing about the disease, the chorus of distant voices
drew us to the window of the convent. A procession of Indians by
torch-light, headed by a native priest, was approaching the church of
the convent, forming one of the sides of the quadrangle in its front,
to implore the removal of the distemper. The half-illumined figures of
the Indians, their far projected shadows, the gloom of the
surrounding scene, the large cross occasionally but faintly disclosed by the
gleam of the torches, and the dashing of the lake upon the shore


* Ce lac parait avoir quelques communications avec les volcans des montagnes qui
1'environnent. Une des preuves les plus fortes qu'on en puisse donner, c'est qu'en 1800,
on vit, pendant les chaleurs, une tres-grande quantise de poissons morts sur la surface
du lac, dont les eaux cesserent d'etres potables, et avaient une odour fetide et corrompue.
Le grande nombre de ces poissons qui suivaient la cours de la riviere, fit craindre la

c'est qu'une tres-grande quantite de ces poissons n'etaient pas entierement morts; le corps
paraissait conserver du mouvement et de la sensibilite, lorsque la tete etait deja en

<!-- Leaf 296, Page: 246 -->
heard in the pauses of the hymn, associated with our recollections of
the romantic tales of our earliest days.


An excellent supper of boiled fowls and Spanish wine prepared
us for our beds. The invalid did not appear at table, but received
his fair proportion of our fare in a separate apartment. Having
been refreshed by a few hours' sleep, we started soon after midnight
for the hot baths, and reached them about six o'clock in the

morning.


As we approached the shore, now lightened by the rising sun, the
beauties of the lake opened upon us in great splendour. The village
of Los Bagnos stands in a recess of the shore, surrounded with conical
hills rising above each other and clothed with a dark foliage chequered
with patches of vivid green to their very summits. The same hills
formed part of a series which winding on our right and left, formed
one of the boundaries of the lake, and gradually vanished in the
distance. The sun, as he rose above the hills, shed his rays on the
glassy surface of the Avater, and disclosed an expanse resembling a
sea in extent, and only broken by a beautifully Avooded island that
seemed to rest like a bird upon the waves.


We landed opposite a small convent in a state of great decay. On
our left was the native village of bamboo huts raised. On our right
were some small round buildings with doomed roofs, enveloped in
the steam which issued from them. Steam was also rising in
several places from the Avoods at their back, and might have been
supposed the smoke of cottages buried in their shade.


Impatient to examine the objects around us, we hastened to the
convent, and after some time awakened and astonished its inmates.
It was inhabited by one of the native priests, and one or two
females of rather doubtful relation to the worthy father. Having
passed through a large lumber room and up a ladder, we entered
a spacious apartment furnished with a large table and a few old
chairs, and communicating at one end with the chapel, and at
the other with the dormitory of the establishment. From the latter
came forth, on our entrance, the clerigo, in person and dress so
<!-- Leaf 297, Page: 247 -->
grotesque, as to tax our risibility, very severely in avoiding to
offend him by our mirth. Imagine a figure little more than five
feet high, having a large head with black hair, projecting forehead
with a wart in the centre that looked like the budding of a horn,
pig's eyes, flat nose, expanded nostrils, wide mouth and thick lips,
dressed in an old-fashioned suit of black cloth, without stockings, and
his shirt hanging below his knees, rushing out wild with astonishment,
and only answering with grins the questions put to him. When the
excess of surprise was passed, he walked successively round each of
the party, vieAving him narrowly from head to foot, but at length was
motioning us to be seated, when he found fresh occasion for
astonishment. Mr. Griffith, the chaplain to the Embassy, had entered the
room with a double-barrelled gun in his hand, and was now
introduced as a brother clerigo. A protestant clergyman Avas, no doubt,
in himself an object of great curiosity to one brought up in the
extreme of bigotry, but a clergyman with a double-barrelled gun
seemed to disturb all his notions of ecclesiastical propriety. He
immediately went up to Griffith and examined him with great
deliberation, walked round him again and again, and did not recover himself
till repeated requests for refreshment induced him to depart. He soon
re-appeared with shoes and buckles, and his shirt properly adjusted,
and calling loudly about him, brought out one of his female
associates, a very striking contrast to himself. With some of his
peculiarities of physiognomy, she was tall, thin, and withered, decorated
with crucifixes and other ornaments, and might have illustrated
Smollett's description of the Indian wife of Lismahago. She had
more self-possession than her friend, and speedily supplied us with
some delicious chocolate, the famed produce and preparation of the
island. Having drunk it, large glasses full of the coldest Avater that
could be procured was, according to the custom of the country,
handed to us. As the chocolate is taken very hot, a draught of cold
water after it is a great luxury, and according to local report, very
wholesome.  
  
  
  On visiting the hot springs we found several of them situated
<!-- Leaf 298, Page: 248 -->
nearly in front of the convent, and on the very margin of the lake.
They rise bubbling through the surface, and forming small streams,
unite in a torrent which flows into the lake. Round buildings with
doomed roofs have been built over many of them to serve as
vapourbaths; and the water of others are conducted into large tanks, which
serve as open baths. These were formerly used as appendages to an
hospital built for the use of the natives; but the baths are in ruins,
and the hospital has entirely disappeared.

The construction of the vapour-baths was very simple, and had

been probably well adapted to its purpose. On looking into them
by a very small door, I found a floor formed by a bamboo frame
laid over the hot spring, which had been formed into a well
several feet in depth. It had been originally intended that the
patient should stand on the bamboo, and thus be enveloped in
steam; but this purpose could not be effected when I saw them,
as the water rose above the frames, and was intolerably hot. There
were three baths, which were all supplied, as far as I could judge,
by the same stream, which having run under them and
successively filled the respective reservoirs, passed off in a channel to
the lake. The water of the bath nearest the source of the spring,
raised a thermometer immersed in it to 174° of Fahrenheit, and  
  
  
  the steam of the same bath to 108°; the water of the second
•bath raised it to 168° and its steam to 100°; the water of the third
bath to 164° and its steam to 99°. Aided by a pair of thick shoes I
ventured unto the bamboo in the bath of lowest temperature; and
felt no other inconvenience than the sense of great heat on first
entering, and was less sensible of this in a few seconds. My
respiration was quite easy, and my pulse beat at 108 full and soft. I had
only remained long enough to ascertain these facts, when the heat
at my feet drove me away.  
  
  
  
The temperature of one of the springs, at its source in the open
air, was higher than that of any of the baths, being 180°. The
loAvest temperature of any of the springs was 120°. The
temperature of a large stream, at its junction with the lake, was 168°. In
<!-- Leaf 299, Page: 249 -->
bathing a few yards from the point of communication, we
experienced a singular but pleasant sensation produced by an alternate
flow of hot and cold water.


By far the most interesting and singular hot stream, in the hidden
recesses of a wood, was discovered by the steam ascending above
the trees in seAreral directions, marking its devious course. It had
worn a deep and unequal bed in a rock of compact lava, the
surface of which it had rendered soft, and was overhung with trees
of luxuriant foliage, and fringed with flowers of delicate hues. I did
not meet Avith this rivulet, the temperature of which was 160°, till
within an hour of leaving Los Bagnos, and could not therefore
follow its windings and trace its source. It was with the greatest
reluctance that I was compelled to quit a scene replete with more
novelty than any that I had ever before witnessed. Let my reader
picture to himself a smoking stream running with much force over a
rocky bed, through a wood of umbrageous trees whose branches met
above it, and he may form some slight notion of its very peculiar
characters.


Sonnerat has stated, and his statement has been copied by other
authors, that a species of fish lives in these springs. It is scarcely
necessary to observe, that I was unable to verify this observation;
All the animals which I saw in them, and I saw two, a small snake
and a frog, Avere not only dead, but boiled. The same author
states that a plant vegetates in them, and in this respect my
experience partially accords with his. I found a small plant, apparently
a species of Arenaria, vegetating in a soil that raised the
thermometer plunged amongst its roots to 110°, on the side of a spring,
the temperature of which was 120°.


The hot springs were so mingled with others of the
temperature of the surrounding atmosphere, that it was easy to put one
hand into hot and the other into cold water. St. Croix states that
some of the springs, near their source in the mountains, have a
very strong taste of copper. I could discover no metallic flavour,  
  
  
  K K
<!-- Leaf 300, Page: 250 -->
but observed an ochreous film floating on the surface of some
cold pools; and a deposit of the same kind on the banks of one or
two of the hot springs.


It is said that the craters of extinguished volcanoes exist in the
neighbourhood of Los Bagnos, and contain a considerable expanse
and depth of water, the habitation of enormous alligators. That
the mountains chiefly consist of lava is probable, as the shores of
the lake are composed of black sand, the debris of compact lava,
and because the bed of a large river which runs into it is interrupted
with blocks of the same rock.


The woods are very thick, and seem to have been but little trod
by man, and abound in magnificent plants. The unwearied search
of three persons, in a small space within the immediate precincts
of the convent, from early in the morning till late in the evening,
was far from exhausting their numerous species.


The trees which characterise the scenery are different species of
palm, especially the coco nut, Cocos nucifera, and the areca nut,
Areca catechu, and the Nipa fruticans. Of other trees the more
general and conspicuous were the teak tree, Tectona grandis, a
very large non-descript species of Ficus, the jack fruit Artocarpus
incisa, and the bread fruit Artocarpus integra, the guava and mango.
Of the less prominent, t\vo species of mimosa, with white and yellow
flowers, Avere very abundant. Of other plants, I find remaining
to me references to specimens of the genera Asclepias, Bauhinia,
Cordia, Hedysarum, Hibiscus, Justicia, and Poinciana. On the walls
of the convent a Justicia with yellow flowers grew in the greatest
profusion. The Justicia bicolor was a very common plant on the
margin of the woods, and the Vinca rosea, of great size and beauty,
was the plant of waste ground not only in the neighbourhood of the
convent, but in every place that I visited on the island.


A considerable plantation of a species of Musa, from which the
natives obtain two sets of fibres, the one fine for manufacturing the
nippis, the other coarse for making cordage, grew near the village of
<!-- Leaf 301, Page: 251 -->
Los Bagnos. The nippis is a beautifully clear fabric, which forms the
outer shirt-shaped garment of the native men, and the tunic and
handkerchiefs of the women. It is said to be sometimes made of fibres so
fine that they require to be manufactured under water, because if
exposed to the sun and air they become too fragile to work. The
cordage made from this plant is less prized in the Philippines than
that manufactured from the fibres that grow near the roots of a palm,
and are of a black colour, forming rope called cabo-negro by the
Spaniards, by which name the palm itself is also known. The
cordage is black, and strongly resembles horse-hair. The palm is
no doubt the anau of the Sumatrans, which Mr. Marsden informs
us " is the Borossus gomutus of Loureiro, the Saguerus pinnatus of
the Batavian Transact, and the Cleophora of Gærtner."*


Late in the afternoon the arrival of the Ambassador, Mr. Ellis,
and Captain Maxwell, giving the clerigo fresh occasion for
astonishment, he again repeated his circumambulations. At the table of
His Excellency, at which he was with much difficulty induced to
take a seat, he gained himself a higher place in our estimation by
his readiness in giving a complimentary turn to his answers when
questioned by the Ambassador. Whilst thus situated, his female
companion and a young girl stood apart at some distance, and
seemed as much amused Avith his grotesque appearance as any other
of the party, expressing their emotion by the most immoderate fits
of laughter.


Having passed the night the greater part of us on benches and
tables in the refectory, or in the chapel surrounded by the images of
the virgin and of the saints, we again embarked on the lake, and
after a very boisterous passage arrived at Manilla the same evening,
and immediately went on board the Alceste.


Early the next morning we left Manilla Bay with a favourable
breeze, and were out of sight of land before dark. On the 16th we  
  
  
  * Marsden's Sumatra, p. 88.
K K 2
<!-- Leaf 302, Page: 252 -->
made the Great Natunas, and the next day passed the Timbelan
Islands, and that night discovered Gaspar island, having run about one
hundred and sixty miles a day in nearly smooth water. Expecting to
be in the straits of Gaspar the next morning, I rose early to ascertain
our situation, and looking from my cabin window, saw Pulo-Leat,.a
finely wooded island close on our larboard beam. The morning was
fine, the wind was fresh and favourable, and the vessel was moving
rapidly through the water; every appearance promised a rapid passage
through the straits which we had just entered. I had scarcely
withdrawn, when a violent vibration of the whole ship, accompanied by a
rumbling noise, urged me again to look out; the vessel no longer
moved, and the waves beat against her like a rock. She had struck on a
coral reef*, and having grated over it for a few seconds, heeled slightly
over to the starboard side and settled upon it. On deck, where I
instantly hastened, every countenance told the distressing truth. A dead
silence prevailed for some moments, every man retaining the posture
in which the disaster found him, till Captain Maxwell, by his orders,
roused the suspended faculties of all. " All hands on deck to shorten
sail—man the pumps—clear the best bower anchor," were the
almost simultaneous orders. An attempt was then made by
throwing the sails aback to drive the ship off the rock, but in vain. The
rapidity of her motion at the instant of striking, rendered it highly
probable that she had received serious injury; but every doubt on
this subject was soon removed by the appearance of large portions
of the keel floating alongside, and by the report of the carpenter.
He had sounded the well, and found two feet and a half Avater, and
soon after seven feet, and that it continued to gain rapidly. Every
sail was now taken in, and the anchor was let go to keep the ship
upon the rock, from the apprehension, if she went off, of her instantly
sinking. Some bread and powder were then attempted to be saved;


* In a chart by Captain Lestock Wilson, the track of his ship Vansittart passes over
the very spot where the Alceste struck, and eighteen fathoms water arc marked in the
same place.
<!-- Leaf 303, Page: 253 -->
but before they could be reached, the magazine and bread-room were
under water.


At this crisis, when our safety hung probably on the most feeble
chance, no disorder prevailed; every man did his duty calmly,
diligently, and effectually. The boats being cleared and lowered, the
Ambassador, his suite, and part of his guard, within half an hour
after the striking of the vessel, were in the barge, and making for the
nearest point of land, distant about three miles. After leaving
the vessel we saw more accurately the dangerous nature of her
situation. The reef on which she had struck was distinctly seen
from the boat extending a few yards from her. Beyond, the water
was dark and deep, and continued so for nearly half a mile, and
then became so shallow that the beautiful but fatal coral was
continually seen as we approached the shore. When about a mile from
the land, sunken rocks covered by not more than from one to three
feet water, surrounded us on all sides. The boat struck several
times, but was saved from any serious accident by the skill of
Lieut. Hoppner who commanded her. After sailing or rowing for
about an hour, we gained what had appeared from the ship to be land
covered Avith Wood, but to our mortification discovered nothing but
insulated masses of granite interspersed with trees growing in the
water. The rocks being too small to receive us, and not appearing
to be above high Avater mark, some men Avere sent forward amongst
the trees to seek for land, but returned after a fruitless search.


Having been joined by the other barge, with the servants of the
Embassy, we coasted along the shore in quest of a more convenient
place for debarkation. Several creeks which seemed to penetrate
inland were in vain explored, they all terminated in deep swamps.
Similar attempts were reiterated, till anxiety to send back the boats
for the relief of others on board determined His Excellency to land
on the first rocks Avhich should be found sufficiently large or
numerous for the reception of the party. This intention was at length
effected in a small bay, where the rocks Avere so mingled with
trees as to afford firm hand-hold. Having with some difficulty
<!-- Leaf 304, Page: 254 -->
placed ourselves upon them above the rise of the tide, and having
taken our fire-arms from the boats, they immediately returned to
the ship.


Several gentlemen now went forward over the rocks, and soon
returned with intelligence that land was not far a-head. A party
was therefore dispatched to examine it more closely; and proceeding
in the direction of the shore discovered a more convenient landing
place, and a small hill on which an encampment might be formed.
Several men were immediately dispatched to this place to fell trees,
and to clear a space for the reception of persons and baggage; and
a marine was stationed on a projecting rock to direct the boats to
the new landing-place as they successively approached the island.


We had now leisure to contemplate some of the circumstances of
our situation. Spars and planks, the remains of a boat, and the
marks of fires scattered amongst the rocks on which we first obtained
footing, indicated that other unfortunates had, at some period, found
on the same island a doubtful asylum. The roots of trees intertwining
Avith each other, and forming arches over a bog which exhaled a
disgusting effluvia, formed the path from this place to the hill. No
vestige of a human habitation was visible, and the discordant
screeching of a bird alone marked the presence of any animated being. The
heat of the day as it advanced, and the exertions of the men in
clearing the ground, produced great thirst, and rendered it
necessary immediately to seek for water, of which scarcely any had been
saved. A search for this purpose was conducted in several
directions without success; and night coming on, was relinquished in the
hopes of better fortune on the morrow.


During the whole day, and till a late hour in the evening, boats
were employed in bringing provisions and baggage from the ship.

At the commencement of the evening all those who had landed
being assembled at the place of encampment on the hill, a table
formed of boxes and hampers was covered with what provisions
were at hand. The Ambassador, the gentlemen of his suit, and
the officers on shore, sat down to a gloomy and unrefreshing meal;
<!-- Leaf 305, Page: 255 -->
the seamen were served with biscuit and rum, and the servants
were supplied from the Ambassador's table. Exhausted by the
fatigues of the day we were glad, soon after our repast, to seek some
rest.


Nothing could be more mournfully picturesque than the scene
which about this time presented itself. The place in which the table
had been spread was a cleared space of about twenty feet square, in
the midst of a wood on the declivity of a hill to which an avenue had
been cut from the sea-side. It served as a sleeping ground to many
of the party. At its extreme part towards the hill, the
Ambassador's cot was suspended between two trees, its white curtains
forming a curious contrast to the sable foliage by which it was
surrounded. Along its sides and those of the avenue, hampers,
trunks, bags, Chinese toys, and an endless variety of other articles
were scattered in wild confusion. Reclined on the larger packages
were the wearied seamen, whose jokes proved their insensibility to
their situation, and were sadly contrasted with the moans of some
sick men placed apart from their companions in recesses cut amongst
the trees. The dull light of a few candles threw a meagre gleam
over these objects, and scarcely showed to the cots and hammocks
suspended amongst the trees, or strewn on the ground, the few who
obtained them: the greater number of the party considered
themselves fortunate if they found flags or blankets to defend them from
the ground. Fires being lighted and sentries placed, to defend us
from any possible danger, we laid ourselves down to watch anxiously
for day-light. Captain Maxwell and a part of his officers and crew
remained on the wreck all night.


Early the next morning the party rose with a painful thirst, and
without the means of satisfying it, but many materially lessened
it by bathing. Several detachments, headed by gentlemen of the
Embassy and officers of the ship, started in several directions to dig
for water; but returned, in different parts of the day, without having
gained their object. Others, amongst whom Avas the author of this
narrative, visited the ship by one of the first boats that returned to
<!-- Leaf 306, Page: 256 -->
her, and on their way met Captain Maxwell going on shore, where
his presence was likely'to be of the greatest service in establishing
order amongst his men, and where his counsel was required
respecting the best means of procuring relief from some neighbouring port.
He expressed great concern that no water had been discovered on
the island, as very little had yet been obtained from the wreck.

We found, on reaching the vessel, that she had heeled over so
much on her starboard side, that it was very difficult to mount her

quarter-deck by the larboard gangway. The topmasts had been cut
away, some of the yards had been lowered, and others were taking
down to form rafts for the conveyance of things on shore, and for
the safety of those on board in the event of any sudden breaking up
of the vessel, whose timbers threatened to give way about midships.


The noise, and the scene which prevailed on board, were
inexpressibly awful. The Avind was high and the swell of the sea
considerable, and the vessel knocked fearfully against the rock. The
rending of the sails, the rattling of the ropes, the splashing of the
waves, the howl of the winds, the roar of the sea, and the shouts of
the seamen, combined in horrid confusion. Linen, books, and all
kinds of packages, covered the upper deck. The water rose to the
main deck from below, and beat over it through the starboard ports.
Pieces of furniture floated in every direction. The cabins, in which
but two days before we had reposed in comfort and security, were
either empty, or filled with motley lumber. One alone was ari
exception to this state. A collection of plants, seeds, and minerals,
which had been made in China, was still in a great measure
uninjured, but only mocked the vexation of the owner, who saw no chance
of preserving it. Every one at the time being necessarily too intent
on securing the means of general subsistence to attend to an
individual's interests, it could only be recommended to the attention of
the officer commanding on board, and by his directions was
afterwards placed on a raft, which, with every thing upon it, was burnt by

the Malays.  
  
  
  Whilst we remained on board, two casks of water floated up from
<!-- Leaf 307, Page: 257 -->
the bottom of the ship, and were immediately hoisted on deck. So
invaluable a prize in our circumstances must have ensured, it will
be imagined, all possible care; yet such was the inconsiderateness of
the sailors, that they staved one of them in getting it over the side
of the ship, through mere heedlessness.


The Ambassador, during our absence from the island, had
resolved to embark with his suite in the barge, and with the cutter
in company, to sail for Batavia that evening, for the purpose of
obtaining as early relief as possible for his fellow-sufferers. Being
informed of this arrangement by a message from Captain Maxwell,
we hastened on shore. The barge had put off before we arrived,
but waited for the cutter outside a reef about a mile and a half from
shore.


After taking a hasty farewell of my friends, I went on board the
cutter, and reached the barge about half-past, six. She contained
the Ambassador, the Hon. Mr. Amherst, Mr. Somerset, the
gentlemen of the suite, Mr. Cook, captain of the guard, and Lieutenant
Hoppner commanding the boat, fifteen seamen, four marines, and
two servants; in all thirty-three. In the cutter were Mr. Mayne,
master of the Alceste, Mr. Blair, midshipman, ten seamen, and three
marines. Having been detained some time alongside each other in
distributing arms and provisions, and in determining on signals and
their mode of sailing, the boats got under weigh at seven o'clock,
the cutter taking the lead.


The objects immediately to be attended to were the sunken
rocks which stretched out a considerable distance from the shores,
and the pirates who infested the seas and inhabited the islands
in our neighbourhood. To avoid the first, we stood directly out to
sea for more than an hour, and then having sounded in nineteen
fathoms, steered a southerly course: to avoid the pirates, we
endeavoured to clear land during the night.


At day-light the next morning no other land than the extreme
point of Banca was visible. Our stock of provisions and water
having been examined, a small allowance of each, with a proportion  
  
  
  L L
<!-- Leaf 308, Page: 258 -->
of rum, was served out to the two boats. Of meat and biscuit we
had enough to last on a short allowance to the end of our voyage,
if it should prove at all favourable; but of water we had not more
than seven or eight gallons for forty-seven persons. Of rum and
wine there was a full quantity; but these were more likely to
increase than assuage thirst, from which, considering our latitude,
we were to expect our chief suffering. But our apprehensions
in this respect were in some measure relieved about ten o'clock in
the morning, by a heavy fall of rain, of which we caught seven
or eight gallons by different methods. Having an awning over the
after-part of the boat, we obtained a considerable quantity of the
water which ran from it, but found it so strongly impregnated with
paint as not to be drinkable. A blanket was therefore spread, and
soon gave a bucket full: an inverted umbrella, which collected water
as in a funnel, was also of great use.


At twelve o'clock at noon we were, by several observations, in
lat. 3° 39' South, long. 106° 39' East, Batavia bearing S.S.W.
distant 152 miles. A squall, which brought the rain, having been
followed by a dead calm, the crews of the boats were immediately
divided into two watches each, who rowed alternately. At the
close of day the barge spoke the cutter and gave her an allowance
of biscuit and rum, and a light, which had been obtained with the
greatest difficulty by firing gunpowder on oakum.


At the approach of night a gloom stole over our spirits, and was
considerably increased by the calm, which, calling for a great
exertion on the part of the men, made us tremble for their strength,
whilst it gave the probability of a long and painful voyage. To
relieve them as much as possible, every person of the suite
occasionally rowed, exciting by his example the emulation of the men;
but the cheering exhortations of our gallant officer accompanying
the strokes of his effective oar, was of more sensible advantage:
<* Never say die my lads," was a certain appeal to the energy,and
the pride of his men.  
  
  
  The calm continued all night, but a breeze which sprung up the
<!-- Leaf 309 -->

<!-- Leaf 311, Page: 259 -->
next morning enabled us, with the assistance of the oars, to make
some way. At noon we found ourselves in lat. 4° 52' 30" S., long.
106° 45' East, Batavia being distant 78 miles. The wind again failed
us early in the afternoon, and did not spring up till the next day.


In the evening the whole party began to feel the inconvenience of
their constrained situation, having been unable to get out of the
sitting posture. One or two attempted to lie at the bottom of the
boat, but were effectually prevented, by the feet of their companions,
from obtaining any rest.


The following day at noon we were by observation in lat. 5° 35 S.,
long. 106° 37' E., Batavia bearing South 22° E. distance 38 miles.
Our approach to land Avas marked by large trees floating past us
covered with birds. At half-past three the cutter, which was two
miles a-head of the barge, hoisted her colours, as a signal for land,
which was soon afterwards distinctly seen bearing south-east,
distant about ten or twelve miles. Every exertion was immediately
made to gain it before night, but the land-breeze coming very strong
off shore, the boats were obliged, about six o'clock, to come to an
anchor. The men were at this time giving way very fast: their
thirst Avas so intense that many attempted to relieve their suffering
by drinking salt water; and one man was taken severely ill with
pain in the head and delirium, and uttered the most lamentable
cries.


About eight P. M. the breeze slackening, we again attempted to
gain the shore by rowing; but were obliged by the weakness of
the men, and the force of an adverse current, again to anchor about
six miles from Krawang Point. Although so near the shore, this
was one of our most uncomfortable nights. The swell of the sea
was so great that the rolling of the boat scarcely allowed us to keep
our seats; and our spirits, worn by anxiety and watching, were not
in a state to encounter with composure any fresh inconvenience.


At day-light the next morning the oars were once more plied,
and with better effect. Soon after shutting in Krawang Point, one of
the men being observed drinking the water alongside, received a

severe reprimand. The poor fellow paid little attention to the
expostulation till he had taken a hearty draught, and then swore " 'twas
fresh;" and fresh it proved, for we were now opposite the mouth of
the Krawang river, whose waters, from their lower specific gravity,
rolled on the surface of the sea. This unexpected and seasonable
supply gave us fresh vigour; the men tugged lustily at the oars, and a
sea-breeze springing up, every sail was set to a favouring gale. The
masts of the ships in Batavia Roads were soon visible, and by
halfpast ten A. M. we Avere alongside the Princess Charlotte transport,
of Whitehaven, and received by her commander, Captain M'Kain,
with all possible kindness and hospitality. Our appearance on
reaching his ship sufficiently indicated our misfortunes. Many of
the party had lost their hats and shoes; scarcely one had a coat; the
faces of several had been skinned by the sun, and al had beards of a
week's growth. It would be in vain to describe our sensations at
this fortunate termination of our voyage. They who have never
experienced, for a considerable period, a painful anxiety under
circumstances of danger and deprivation, can scarcely appreciate the feelings
consequent on their cessation. But whatever were the emotions of
our minds, or the wants of our bodies, their influence did not
prevent the Ambassador from immediately attending to the relief of
our friends on the island. It was ascertained, in a few minutes after
our arrival, that the Honourable East India Company's cruizer
Ternate, Captain Davidson, Avas then in the roads, and that she
would probably be a fit vessel to dispatch to their assistance. Mr.
Ellis, with his usual alacrity in the service of others, instantly
volunteered to enquire into the business, and soon ascertained that
she was well adapted to the service in view, inasmuch as she sailed
well and drew little water; but he feared she was too small to hold
the whole party, together Avith the luggage saved from the wreck.
It was, therefore, determined that the Princess Charlotte should
accompany her; and both these vessels sailed for Pulo Leat at
daybreak the next morning.  
  
  
  The Ambassador having learnt that the English Governor, the
<!-- Leaf 313, Page: 261 -->
Honourable Mr. Fendal, and Sir William Keir, Bart., commander of
the British forces in Java, had not quitted the island, dispatched
letters to them, and to the Dutch Governor, Baron Van der Capellan,
stating our situation. Mr. Cooke, who carried them on shore, soon
returned with intelligence that boats were coming off to take us to
Batavia. An aide-de-camp also arrived from the Baron Avith an
invitation to the Ambassador and gentlemen of his suite to his house,
and the offer of every supply our necessities might require. The
boats arrived at four o'clock, and took the Ambassador and his
suite on shore, where carriages waited our arrival to convey us to
the house of His Excellency the Dutch Governor, with whom we
dined; but through the active kindness of our English friends, did
not find it necessary to accept of his proffered services to their full
extent.


I have now related all those circumstances of the unfortunate
wreck of the Alceste of which I was a witness. For the following
brief narratiATe of the occurrences on the island, after the departure
of the Ambassador, I am indebted to the Journals kept there by the
Hon. Mr. Abbot and Mr. Brown, and to conversations with several
other officers of the ship.


After the sailing of the Embassy on the evening of the 19th of
February, provisions, baggage, and some water, were landed from the
wreck, but the last in such small quantity that the utmost anxiety
prevailed respecting the result of efforts then making to form a well
at the bottom of the hill. But successive parties having toiled at
it all night, Captain MaxAvell was, before morning, cheered with
the intelligence that water had begun to rise; and on receiving a
specimen found it, although slightly brackish, very drinkable.


It becoming generally known at an early hour that water had risen
to the height of three feet, a general rush was made to the well,
and every thing capable of holding it put into requisition by the
thirsty sufferers. They found the supply too small to afford them
much relief, but received effectual succour in a heavy fall of rain, the
same probably which had reached the barge. Every one being in
<!-- Leaf 314, Page: 262 -->
consequence much refreshed, set actively to work in carrying the
baggage and provisions to the top of the hill, which was three
hundred yards from the landing-place, very abrupt in its ascent, and
covered with thick and prickly underwood. The party also suffered
much from the heat of the sun as the day advanced, and from the
bites of musquitoes and of small black flies, which rose in clouds
beneath their feet.


Through the example of Captain Maxwell, foremost in every
toilsome effort, and the perseverance of his officers and men, every
article on shore was removed to the top of the hill during the
forenoon. This labour accomplished, the men were mustered in
divisions, and addressed by their commander in a few words,
pointing out the necessity of subordination, and reminding them, that
although a sufficient quantity of provisions had been saved to last
them many days, yet as the fate of Lord Amherst and his
companions, on whose safety depended their early succour from Batavia,
must be uncertain, it was necessary to keep on short allowance; and
that, as they were in a situation in which they were liable to the
attacks of pirates, their surest defence would be union and discipline.
Different parties were then directed to separate duties. Whilst one
was employed in tending the landing-place and unlading boats as
they arrived from the wreck, another cleared the hill for a regular
encampment, freeing its summit from the smaller trees and
underwood.


On the morning of the 20th great exhilaration Avas excited by
the discovery that the well would afford a quart of water for each
man; but was speedily diminished by the intelligence that the first
lieutenant and thirty men had been driven from the wreck by some
Malay prows.


It appeared, that whilst all hands on board had been employed in
removing stores unto a raft alongside, two Malay boats, full of men,
were observed bearing down upon them. The party not being
able to muster any other arms than a few handspikes, took to their
boats, and making for the shore, were instantly chased by the Malays.
<!-- Leaf 315, Page: 263 -->
As they approached the island, and were struggling with a baffling
current, eight more Malay boats came round a projecting rock, and
gave them chase. The Malays were gaining rapidly upon them,
when two of the Alceste's boats coming in sight from the
landingplace, the pirates relinquished the pursuit and made for the wreck.


On receiving this information Captain Maxwell ordered the drum
to beat to arms, and all the weapons which had been saved to be
brought together. On examination they were found to consist of a
few rusty muskets, some cutlasses, and the officers' swords. A
small supply of poAvder had been procured from the ship, by drawing
her guns, but of balls there was scarcely a round. Ingenuity quickly
supplied this deficiency in the means of defence. A large number of
young, tall, straight and tough trees, which grew around the
encampment were immediately felled, and formed into pikes of eight feet
in length, having their points hardened by fire; whilst all the
pewter and tin vessels were melted into balls. Measures were then
taken to guard against surprise. The crown of the hill was
surrounded by a strong bulwark formed of the trunks and branches of
trees; and picquets were stationed at the well and at the
landingplace. The day, consumed on the island in the execution of these
necessary measures, was spent by the Malays in plundering the wreck
and landing their booty on a rock in its vicinity.


Having lighted fires, the party retired to rest under much anxiety;
well knowing the ferocious disposition of the Malays, whose numbers
might be readily increased to an overpowering amount.


During the night an alarm was excited through the whole
encampment by the challenge of the sentry, who heard something
approaching him through the neighbouring thicket. A search being
immediately set on foot, the intruder was found to be a large monkey
attacking some fowls at the foot of the hill. Other animals more
disgusting and noxious than monkeys infested the ground of
the encampment: several persons were bitten by scolopendras and
scorpions.  
  
  
  Early the next morning two boats, well manned and armed, Avere
<!-- Leaf 316 -->
2g4 SHIPWRECK.

sent off to take possession of the ship, and to obtain if possible more
arms and provisions. On approaching they saw two Malay prows
leaving, and almost at the same instant observed smoke rising from
several parts of her deck, and driving through the ports; and in
the next, flames bursting from every quarter. Finding it hopeless to
attempt getting on board, the boats returned to the island. The
Malays left the wreck as soon as they had set it on fire, and were
not again seen during the day.


The day having been spent on shore in strengthening the fence,
the party retired within it at night with some confidence; but were
again alarmed, and by the same cause, a large monkey. The sentry
who guarded one of the approaches to the hill, confident that he
saw a Malay, discharged his musket, and roused by its report the
little garrison, who turned out under arms. Their confusion was
much increased by a shout from the picquet at the landing-place,
who, hearing the report of the musket, cheered with the purpose
of awing the pirates. These alarms, although absurd when their
causes were discovered, kept the party on the alert for the remainder
of the night.


Early the next morning a party was again dispatched to the ship,
still on fire, and found her copper on the larboard side alone above
water, and so hot, that by throAving water upon it they scarcely
cooled it sufficiently to permit their getting on board. Here every
object declared the skill of the pirates in the business of destruction.
The masts were totally consumed, and their iron rings had fallen
to the bottom of the wreck. The upper and main decks were
destroyed, and the lower deck was covered with charcoal, which
yielded to the foot, and probably rested on a half-consumed base.
Cases of wine and many other articles in the lower part of the ship
had been preserved from the fire by the water which covered them,
and had floated up in consequence of the destruction of the decks.
After lading the boats with wine, flour, and some arms obtained by
diving, the party returned to the shore.  
  
  
  During the absence of the boats, twelve sail of Malay prows
<!-- Leaf 317 -->

<!-- Leaf 319, Page: 265 -->
came round the south point of the island, and reconnoitred the
landing-place, and had not quitted their situation at the close of
day. The usual precautions being taken, the party retired early
to rest, and passed the night without interruption.


The two folloAving days, during Avhich no prows appeared, were
employed in forming another well, and in completing the
fortification. The latter had now become a fortress of some security. It
consisted of a strong fence six feet broad surrounding the brow of
the hill, and was formed of large piles driven into the ground,
intertwined with the leafy branches of great trees; and it communicated by
tAvo gates commanded by bastions and platforms, with the avenues
leading to the wells and landing-place. Thus protected, the party
felt themselves a match for a force much more numerous than their

own.


Early on the morning of the 26th, two Malay boats having in tow
two canoes laden Avith plunder, being observed off the landing-place,
the barge was manned and armed under the command of Lieutenant
Hay, and sent after them. They immediately cut away their canoes
and made all sail, but were rapidly gained upon by the barge which
soon came up Avith the sternmost. Mr. Hay then made signs for
her to shorten sail and come to a parley; and these not being
attended to, fired a musket to bring her to, but was instantly answered
by a swivel which she mounted in her boAvs. The barge noAv
endeavouring to run alongside, one of the Malays at each attempt pushed
her off with a long pole, whilst his comrades attacked her crew with
their spears and swivel. They threw their spears with great
deliberation, poising them above their heads and taking a steady aim.
A strong side-wind fortunately blowing at the time, drove them
in a slanting direction, broke their force, and rendered them untrue
to their mark. No person in the barge having a serviceable musket,
excepting her commander, he marked the man who managed the
swivel, and brought him down by his first shot; and by his next the
most active spearman. The sailors not being sufficiently near the
pirates to use their cutlasses or boarding-pikes, could only throw  
  
  
  M M
<!-- Leaf 320, Page: 266 -->
back the spears which fell amongst them. To prevent their
escape, they threw the barge's grapnell into the prow, which,
to their astonishment, instantly sunk; the grapnell having
probably passed through her bottom. Six of her men (of whom
there had been ten originally) immediately appeared in the water
swimming with great dexterity. Although three of them were
severely wounded, they all continued to fight, refusing quarter, and
endeavouring to wound the barge's crew with their long spears.
At length the three wounded men, being much exhausted,
were dragged on board; one of them died in a few minutes,
another within an hour, the third survived. Of the others,
one SAvam towards the Alceste's gig which was making after the
barge, and was taken on board, the remaining two disdaining
captivity dived and were seen no more. During the action the other
Malay boat although at no great distance from her consort, did not
attempt to interfere, but setting every sail made her escape. The
barge having returned to the island, the wounded man was
immediately dressed and kindly treated. The dead Malay was buried;
he had been a very powerful man, and even in death excited
admiration by his muscular form and stern countenance. The
prisoner was put under the guard of a marine at some distance from
the fortification, that in case of his escape he might not be able to
carry intelligence of its strength and the numbers of the party to his
companions. The sequel proved the propriety of the measure.
Having been a few days afterwards employed by his guard to cut
wood, he escaped to his companions. None of the barge's crew had
been seriously wounded.


Soon after the return of the barge the midshipman at the look-out
rock reported that fourteen sail of Malay boats were standing down
towards the island from Banca. They soon after anchored
between Pulo Leat and a small island, in the very situation which
Captain Maxwell had pointed out to Lord Amherst for the
anchorage of the prows which, as had been determined upon between
them, should be sent for the relief of the party from Batavia. The
<!-- Leaf 321, Page: 267 -->
hopes of all raised by this circumstance, were further excited by
several men leaving their boats and wading towards the shore, the
foremost of the party bearing in his hand a small flag. Mr. Sykes,
an officer of the Alceste, accompanied by two others, having ih his
hand the English colours, walked out to meet them; and as he
advanced laid down his arms and held up his hands, to show that
he was offenceless: on seeing this the Malays threw aside their
spears. He then made signs that not more than three of them
should come forward, which being complied with, the two parties
soon met. The Malays immediately payed Mr. Sykes every mark
of humility and respect, and were led by him to the Captain, who
anxiously waited their arrival at the landing-place. Through the
medium of a sailor who spoke a little Malay se, he learnt that
they were not from Batavia, and that they had come to Pulo
Leat, to gather sea-slugs and sea-weed. Their spokesman, whom
they called their rajah, was extremely solicitous that the Captain
should visit him on board his prow. This proposition was
urgently opposed by Captain Maxwell's officers and men, who felt
but too well that their own safety depended upon his. Having
continued on the wreck whilst his presence could animate or direct
the exertions of his men, he left it but to assume a more painful
situation on shore. Amidst a variety of dangers constantly
pressing him, from the time that the Embassy left Pulo Leat to his
removal from it, he cheered, restrained, armed, and protected his
men by his counsel and example, and so convinced them of the value
of his existence, that they watched him as the guardian star which
alone could lead them to safety. Several officers accepted the
invitation, and accompanied by a force sufficient for their security against
any perfidious attempt, visited the prow; and having met with
hospitable treatment, returned in the evening with a present of fish and
Indian corn for the Captain.


Early the next morning these amicably disposed Malays were seen
actively plundering the wreck, in which friendly office they were  
  
  
  m m 2
<!-- Leaf 322 -->
2gg SHIPWRECK.

soon after joined by several of the pirates with whom they had
disclaimed all connection.


The pirates probably came from all the different islands in the
neighbourhood, as they bore down upon the wreck in every
direction. Durino* high water their detachments occasionally anchored
as close as possible to the landing-place, with the apparent
intention of reconnoitring, and of intercepting any boat that might
attempt to leave it. With the first purpose also they
communicated with the party under different pretences, and once received
a letter which they engaged to send immediately to Minto, an
European settlement on Banca. When the tide ebbed they got under
sail from the apprehension of grounding, and re-visited the wreck,
but re-appeared off the landing-place at the next flood-tide.


The danger of the shipwrecked band became hourly more
pressing; their enemies increased in number, and the period allowed
for the arrival of intelligence from Batavia had elapsed. The sea
could be distinctly seen for several miles from a tall tree on the
most commanding part of the hill. How anxiously did one or
other watch from its extreme height the approach of any vessel !
In vain did his companions enquire what he saw; " Nothing,"
Avas the usual anwer; or if for a moment he beheld an uncertain
point in the distance, it either expanded into cloud or vanished
into air.


It being now the 1st of March, Captain Maxwell looking to the
possibility of some fatal accident having befallen the Ambassador
and his companions, contemplated an escape with his officers and
men in the boats which remained. He therefore ordered them to be
properly examined, their oars and sails to be repaired, and every
thing to be got ready for cutting through the pirates and making a
voyage to Batavia.


The boats not being thought sufficiently secure at the old
landing-place against any unexpected attack of the Malays, were
removed to one more to the southward, where a sandy beach was
<!-- Leaf 323, Page: 269 -->
covered and commanded by a precipitous rock. The party could
only reach the summit of this by crossing from a lower rock by the
trunk of a tree, which they used as a draw-bridge, and could throw
down at a moment's warning. It was constantly occupied by a
picquet, and from its inaccessibility Avas called the Gibraltar rock.
It communicated with the hill by an irregular avenue cut through
the wood.


Very early in the morning of the second of March
twentynine prows anchored between the tAvo landing-places, and
immediately began to load their swivels and to erect platforms on their
decks. No doubt being entertained that they meditated an
immediate attack, every preparation was made to receive them. The party
was mustered under arms, and double guards were placed at the
landing-places.


In the evening the same rajah, who had before visited the
Captain, came on shore. He still insisted on his friendly views, but
accused a part of his companions, to whose prows he pointed, with
the intention of attacking the party that night, rendering at the
same time his own professions suspicious, by requesting that two of
his people might sleep on the hill; a request that was of course
refused. His probable object in making it was to ascertain the exact
force of the party, of which the Malays had been kept in ignorance,
and no doubt believed to be greater than it was. To produce this
impression, whenever a conference with the pirates took place,
Captain Maxwell so disposed his men, that whilst the usual picquets
were visible to the prows, their ambassadors saw people moving
about them in every direction, some peeping from behind rocks,
and others appearing in different parts of the wood, whilst a body
of officers surrounded themselves.


Having dismissed the rajah, Captain Maxwell mustered his force,
and ascertained accurately the extent of his means of defence. The
party, including servants, consisted of one hundred and ninety men, of
whom forty-two were armed with muskets, forty with boarding-pikes,
<!-- Leaf 324, Page: 270 -->
and twenty with cutlasses; the others with poles, having sharpened
pieces of iron or knives fastened to their ends, or having points
hardened by fire.


The Malays allowing fifteen men to each prow, which was a
moderate calculation, were between four and five hundred in number,
armed with spears and crisses. Taking into consideration every
circumstance, especially his advantage on the score of fire-arms, the
defensible nature of the ground, and the strong position on the
hill, Captain Maxwell felt no apprehension of the result of an
immediate attack. On the other hand, he could not but reflect,
that the number of his enemies would hourly increase, and that
whatever loss they might suffer in action they could readily
compensate; Avhilst his oavii, without relief from Batavia, would be
irretrievable. The gloomy anticipations this last view of his situation
must have excited he locked in his own breast; and having addressed
his men, pointing out in a few words his confidence in their valour,
his certainty of their success, the probability of their being attacked
that night, and the measures he wished to be taken, dismissed
them to their several posts. Those who were not on guard retired
to sleep on their arms, and the pirates did not interrupt their repose.


By day-light the next morning the number of proAVs off the
landing-place had increased to forty-five, and were soon after joined
by ten more. All possible preparation was made to defeat their
attack, but their endless supplies created a cruel anxiety, and the
hopes of succour became feeble as its want became greater. Their
proverbial treachery forbade any attempt at treating with them, and
their force was sufficient, if well exerted, to prevent the arrival of
boats coming to the relief of the party, whilst the rocky and shallow
nature of the coast would not suffer the approach of a ship within
several miles of the island. To conquer or to die was no new or
fearful alternative to British sailors; but to die by the hands of
savages in a remote corner of the world, whence their fate could never
reach the knowledge of their friends, and in a conflict from which their
<!-- Leaf 325, Page: 271 -->
country could derive no good and themselves no glory, was indeed a
bitter thought. In a pensive but determined mood they awaited the
moment of attack, their desperate courage receiving a keener edge
from the known sanguinary and unappeasable temper of their foes.
The day was cloudy with a drizzling rain. Those who occupied the
hill, and were not engaged in duty, separated into groups and took
refuge in their huts, and discussed the various circumstances of
their situation. Whilst anxiously weighing every chance of
relief, and endeavouring to open new paths to hope, an officer on
the look-out tree called out for a telescope. A feverish
expectation agitated all who heard him, but all were silent. They had so
often been deluded by a similar demand, that at first no one dared
to ask what he expected to discover. At length Captain Maxwell
having handed up his glass, ventured to enquire, " Do you see any
thing, Sir ?" " I think I see a sail," was the cautious answer.—" In
what direction ?" " To the southward."—" What kind of vessel is
she?" " I cannot at present determine."^" How is she steering?"
"Apparently N.N.E., but I am not certain." Nearly half an hour
then elapsed in consequence of the haziness of the atmosphere before
more satisfactory answers could be obtained, although " Well what is
she ?" was the repeated demand of the impatient expectants. At
length the welcome affirmation " She is a square-rigged vessel,
steering N.N.E.," soon followed by " She is preparing to anchor,
but I am losing sight of her under the south point of the island,"
diffused a general and a cheering hope. In the next instant it
was reported from the landing-place, that the whole Malay force,
having seen the vessel, were getting under weigh and endeavouring
to effect their retreat. Every one immediately hastened to the
shore, and beheld the pirates crowding all sail and standing from
the island. In their haste to be off, two of their prows grounded,
but got clear before they could be reached by a party of the
Alceste's officers and men who, armed with pikes, rushed into the
water and swam after them.
<!-- Leaf 326, Page: 272 -->

A party now went round to the south point of the island, and
having obtained a view of the ship, returned with the intelligence that
she was at anchor about twelve miles from the island, and had hoisted
English colours. As it was possible that she might not have
arrived for the purpose of relieving the party on the island, it was
necessary, if possible, to communicate with her immediately, to
prevent the chance of her getting under weigh during the night.
To do this was somewhat difficult, as it Avas nearly dark, and low
water, and a boat might be intercepted by some lurking prows; yet
notwithstanding these obstacles, the attempt was made, and happily
succeeded. The gig was carried for nearly a mile over the shallows
on the shoulders of her crew into deep water, and under the command
of Mr. Sykes and Mr. Abbot, dispatched for that purpose. These
gentlemen having got round a small island off the Avest point of Pulo
Leat before dark, obtained sight of the vessel, and having taken her
bearings, made the most of a favourable breeze, and reached her about
nine o'clock. On mounting her deck, they encountered in Mr. Ellis a
sufficient explanation of the occasion of her arrival. She proved to
be the Ternate, who had parted company with the Princess
Charlotte soon after leaving Batavia Roads.


Captain Maxwell having seen the gig fairly off, assembled his
men, and having expressed to them his entire approbation of their
conduct up to that moment, declared his intention to permit no
relaxation of discipline as a consequence of the arrival of the ship
and of the disappearance of the pirates. The former, he observed,
might have arrived without the intention or the means of succour,
and the latter might return in a few hours with redoubled force.


It was ten o'clock the next morning before the gig returned
to the island. She had left the Ternate at four A.M., but had
been prevented by the force of a contrary wind and current from
arriving earlier, not being able to contend against them. The
Ternate's cutter, which had left the ship at the same time, was
compelled to return. In the afternoon, one of the Alceste's
boats was sent off to the Ternate for a carronade and a supply
<!-- Leaf 327, Page: 273 -->
of ammunition, and returned with them early the next morning.
The carronade being immediately mounted in the launch and loaded
with cannister shot, its range and effect were tried and found so
satisfactory, that the return of the Malays was heartily desired:
they did not revisit the island till after the departure of the Ternate.
Two boats were sent off to the ship during the day with some sick
and lame men and a quantity of provisions and baggage, and a large
raft was formed to assist in the conveyance of the persons and
things that remained.


On the 6th, all but the Captain and eighty men had left the
island and were safe on board the Ternate, Avith the greater part of
the removable packages. Early on the following morning, Captain
Maxwell and the last of the party, after burning the fence and every
article that could not be carried off, took their farewell of Pulo
Leat. By ten o'clock, all the party being safely on board the
Ternate, she got under weigh for Batavia Roads, and anchored in them
on the afternoon of the 10th of March.


The Princess Charlotte did not arrive off the island till several
days after the Ternate had left it, and was then obliged by adverse
currents to anchor twenty miles from the shore. One of her boats,
having on board Mr. Mayne and Mr. Marrige, immediately
attempted to reach it; and on approaching the old landing-place,
found a fleet of Malay prows at anchor. She immediately put about,
but not before she was seen by the pirates, and chased by two
heavy prows full of men. The pirates gained rapidly upon her, and
but for one of those providential circumstances which had more
than once saved the shipwrecked band, would have overtaken and
overwhelmed her feeble crew. The winds had been so light, that
the boat had been obliged to depend chiefly on her oars for making
any way, whilst the large spread of canvass used by the prows,
enabled them, even in a very light breeze, to go fast through the
water. At the moment that escape seemed most doubtful, a heavy
squall filled the sails of the boat, and frightened the Malays back to
the island.

  CHAPTER X.

In my first visit to Java, my opportunities of seeing the island were
confined to a few excursions into the interior; but they enabled me
to estimate the amiableness of the natives, to enjoy the delightful
scenery, and to examine some of the singular productions of their
much-favoured land. In my second unforeseen, but more
lengthened visit, when deprived of all means of scientific research, and
all the objects for which I had undertaken the voyage, I readily
yielded to the dissipation by which the equal kindness of our
countrymen and Baron Van der Capellan hoped to seduce us into a
forgetfulness of our misfortunes. The seven weeks that we remained
on the island were almost entirely spent in the immediate vicinity of
Batavia; and although they afforded us ample opportunities of
observing the manners of the colonists, gave us few facilities for
holding any intercourse with the natives. In looking over my journal,
I find one day's occupation so very similar to another, that in taking
my reader through a day's routine of engagement, I shall do my
best to give him a notion of the local circumstances that meet the
eye of a temporary dweller in the purlieus of Batavia.


Batavia is built in a low, swampy soil, close to the sea; its streets
running nearly north and south, at right angles with the beach.
These streets are very broad, and many of them terminate in fine
roads leading into the heart of the island. On the principal of
these, about three miles from the town, at a place called
Weltervreden, Avas situated the cantonment of our troops; and here
were the quarters of the Embassy, whilst they remained in Java.
<!-- Leaf 329, Page: 275 -->
The house Avhich they occupied was the ordinary residence of Mr.
Fendall, confined at the time by illness to his country seat. It was
situated on the western side of a large plain, opposite to an immense
massy unfinished stone building, begun by General Dandals, and
intended as a residence for the Dutch governor. A few hundred
yards to the left, on the opposite side of the road, and on the
northern side of the plain, was the house of the
Commander-inchief of the British forces, before which the English flag was still
hoisted. On the right and on the southern side of the plain were
stone barracks, occupied on our arrival by part of a British regiment
still remaining on the island, but which gave place to the
shipwrecked crew of the Alceste. The road passing in front of our quarters
led to the intrenched camp of Cornelis, and beyond to Buitenzorg,
the country-seat of the Dutch Governor. By crossing the road and
the plain, we reached a bazaar, or market, and through it a second
road parallel to the other, also terminating in one of the streets of
Batavia. The bazaar was composed of two lines of shops extending
about four hundred yards, and occupied by natives and Chinese. The
former Avere chiefly venders of fruits and vegetables; the latter of
manufactured articles, both domestic and foreign.


Visiting Batavia by the way of the bazaar was my frequent exercise
early in the morning, when the fresh land-breezes gave rather the
coolness of a temperate than the heat of a torrid zone. I usually
reached it Avhen the natives were bringing their vegetables to the
market, and witnessed that abundance and variety of delicious
fruit which form such a peculiar and attractive character of many
countries bordering on the equator, but more especially of Java:
the stranger, in purchasing fruits in this island, finds no coin too
insignificant to obtain them in abundance. Their kinds were too
numerous and too novel to admit their recognition then, and

still less their enumeration noAv; but I may notice a few of the
principal.


First in beauty and flavour was the celebrated Mangostan. This
fruit, which has been so often eulogized by different travellers,cerN n 2
<!-- Leaf 330, Page: 276 -->
tainly merits much of the praise that has been lavished upon it.
It is of a spherical form, of the size of a small orange; is when
young, of a reddish green colour; when ripe, of a reddish brown;
and when old, of a chesnut brown colour. Its succulent rind is
nearly the fourth of an inch in thickness, contains a very powerful
astringent juice, and in wet weather exudes a yelloAV gum, which
is a variety of gamboge.* On removing the rind, its esculent
substance appears in the form of a juicy pulp, having the Avhiteness
and solubility of snow, and a refreshing, delicate, delicious flavour.
To define it by more precise language is very difficult. We were all
anxious to carry away with us some precise expression of its
qualities, but after satisfying ourselves that it partook of the compound
taste of the pine-apple and the peach, we Avere obliged to confess
that it had many other equally good, but utterly inexpressible,
flavours. This fruit, from its perfect wholesomeness, may be eaten in
any quantity; and as it possesses no luscious qualities, it does not
soon cloy the palate. The mangostan tree is worthy of the fruit it
bears. It grows to the size of a very large cherry-tree. Its leaves are
three or four inches long, of an oval form, of a shining green colour,
and might be taken for those of a magnolia. Its blossom is a
spreading corrolla of four petals, of a reddish pink colour, and often
decorates the plant at the same time with its fruit. Its branches
are pendant, and, when loaded with fruit, curve in graceful arches
quite round the stem. As much of the habit of this plant as
can be expressed by a branch, is beautifully given in the Atlas to
Mr. Marsden's History of Sumatra.


The bazaar afforded in equal profusion Avith the mangostan, the
custard apple, rambootan, poolosan, and dorian. The custard apple
well deserves its name, for its loose pulp enveloping black seeds
more resembles in flavour a mixture of apple tart and custard, than


• The gamboge of commerce is derived from a plant, Garcinia Cambogia, of the same
genus as the Mangostan, Ganinia Mangostana.
<!-- Leaf 331, Page: 277 -->
any thing else to which it can be compared. The rambootan, which
is well figured in Mr. Barow's work on Cochin-China, is a red
fruit about the size of a plover's egg, and is covered with long
hair-like processes, whence its name, rambootan or hairy fruit. On
removing a thin rind, lined with a substance much resembling
white French kid, the pulp appears in the form of the plover's
egg, boiled and deprived of its shell. Its flavour is very agreeable,
and apart from the mangostan would be considered excellent. The
poloosan, in the form and flavour of its pulp, resembles the
rambootan, but is thought the better fruit; it differs from the rambootan
in wanting the hairy processes. The dorian, to taste which the first
time requires some resolution, is a large fruit of a roundish oval
form, and in size and in the colour of its elevations on its surface,
is not unlike the pine-apple, but is the produce of a large tree.
The esculent part of the fruit enclosed in a thick rind, consists of a
yellowish white pulp enveloping several large seeds. Its smell to a
stranger is quite intolerable, and arises from sulphuretted hydrogen,
which stains silver spoons used in eating it. Although its flavour
is at first scarcely more agreeable, it is voraciously devoured by the
natives, and is soon highly relished by Europeans, who lose the
consciousness of its odour.


Pine apples, cocoa nuts, and the bread fruit, are too well known to
require any description; and with respect to their abundance I have
only to remark, it would be difficult to name either fruit or vegetable
that is so common in England as they are in Java.


Beyond the bazaar, I entered on the road, lined on both sides
with tall trees, chiefly the Canarium commune, growing on the banks
of canals, always filled at an early hour with natives of both sexes.
The women had on a kind of petticoat, which reached above the
breasts; the men were entirely naked. The dwellings of these
people, formed of bamboo and the leaves of palm, and sheltered
from the sun by the various shade of palms, mangostans, and
bananas, stretched in long lines on the banks of the canal. In a
plantation of cocoa nuts and sugar trees I drank of a liquor called
<!-- Leaf 332, Page: 278 -->
toddy, obtained from the latter. The sugar tree is a tall palm,
bearing a round fruit, which grows in large bunches from a common
footstalk. To obtain the toddy the natives wound the stalk beyond
the bunch, and place a vessel beneath it; and having allowed it
to remain all night, find it in the morning full of sap. When
drunk before sun-rise this fluid is a refreshing brisk beverage
containing much carbonic acid, is much relished by the natives, and
was to my taste very agreeable. As the day advances and the
heat increases, it runs rapidly into the vinous fermentation, and
afterwards passes into vinegar.


The sugar tree, called airang by the natives, is one of the most
valuable plants that nature has given to the Javanese. The same
juice that gives them the toddy affords, by some simple process, a
brown sugar : the finer fibres of the bark are made into excellent
ropes, and the coarser ones are made into pens. I may here
mention that the ink used by the Javanese is beautifully soft and
black, and probably equals in most respects that of the Chinese. At
my request a Javanese manufactured it in my presence. He used
tAvo ingredients, one a gum resin, which he called damuh, and
came, he said, from Sumatra; the other a gum in all respects like
gum arabic, called cowistah. Having filled a joint of bamboo to the
very brim with the damuh reduced to powder, he fixed it in the
ground, and then set the resin on fire, and collected its smoke in
a plate which he suspended over it. When he had thus obtained
a sufficient quantity of its soot he mixed it in a mortar with the
cowistah dissolved in water, and triturated them together till by
an evaporation they obtained the consistence of paste, then placed
them in the sun to dry, and thus completed the process.


I always found in the vicinity of the huts, amongst a variety of
other beautiful plants, the Champaca of the natives and of Linnæus,
the Michelia suaveolens of other authors. Its flowers are used by the
Javanese to perfume and ornament their dress, and to decorate the
dead bodies of their relatives, and are sold in large quantities in all
the bazaars. The Hibiscus rosa Chinensis and the Poinciana
<!-- Leaf 333, Page: 279 -->
pulcherrima were amongst their favourite ornamental plants. The Murraya
exotica and Justicia picta adorned their hedges, and the Gloriosa
superba in full blossom flourished in every moist and shady place;
and the Sida rhombifolia and Phlomis zeylanica were universal on
Avaste ground.


Beyond the huts of the natives the road winds through the
Chinese burial-ground, and changes all its former beauties for the
loathsomeness of a bog covered with tombs. The Chinese
burialground excites the notion of a great battle having been fought, and
the slain having been hastily and promiscuously buried. So crammed
is the whole space with its lifeless inhabitants, that the soil loosened
by fresh burials, has often yielded their remains to the action of
the rain and surrounding Avater which rises all around the graves.
It is impossible to avoid shuddering at the consequences that must
be induced by the quantity of noxious effluvia necessarily engendered
by these circumstances in a country within six degrees of the line.
The Nelumbium and the Lotus, in full bloom, flourished amidst the
tombs, and formed a singular contrast to their gloomy situation.


Beyond the burial-ground the town is soon reached, and affords at
an early hour, the singular spectacle of smiths, carpenters, and other
artisans, chiefly Chinese, going to their day's employment in their
own carriages; a kind of cabriolet, drawn by two Javanese ponies,
which can be kept at a very reasonable rate. All but the very
loAvest class in Java disdaining or being afraid to walk exposed to
the sun, a discriminative mark of rank in other countries is here in
a good measure wanted. After passing through the town of Batavia
I always felt a real or imaginary sickness and torpor.


Many of us, in conformity with the local belief that it is dangerous
to be in the sun after eight o'clock in the morning till five in the
afternoon, kept Avithin the greater part of the day. A party,
however, much to the astonishment of the inhabitants, frequently amused
themselves at cricket in the plain before our quarters, during the
heat of the day; and what perhaps was scarcely to be expected,
took no harm from the exercise.
<!-- Leaf 334, Page: 280 -->

A drive before dinner, after five o'clock, into the town or the
country is the general custom of the colonists, and was one of our
pleasantest amusements. The number of carriages which crowded the
road, and were filled with people of all ranks, ages, sexes, and colours,
forms a highly animated picture. The most brilliant equipage was
that of the first Dutch commissioner, diwn by eight beautiful grey
ponies, driven in hand by his secretary.


Our evenings were sometimes spent at balls given by our
countrymen or by the Dutch authorities, and gave us opportunities of
seeing all the beauty and fashion of the colony. The old Dutch
colonists, who associated but little with the English during the
British government of the island, appear to have altered more in
their dress than their habits since they were described by Mr.
Barow. The gentlemen have laid aside their velvet suits, and the
ladies for the most part have assumed the European costume; but
both sexes are still addicted to heavy meals. About tAvelve the
dancing usually ceased for a time, and a supper consisting of large
joints of different kinds of meat and of fowls was served up, of
which the Dutch part of the company seemed to partake very
heartily. After supper the more moderate guests separated, but a
great number resumed the dance and partook of a second supper
about two or three in the morning; and some choice spirits kept it
up till day-light, and regaled themselves a third time.


Many of the ladies were well dressed, and had personal charms,
especially in the eyes of those who were returning from China. A
few of them appeared in the costume of the country, which had
much to recommend it, being well adapted to the climate. It
consisted of an embroidered robe and petticoat, fitting neatly but not
closely to the form. The robe hung down to the knee, and Avas
confined round the waist by a belt fastened with a clasp glittering
with diamonds. The gentlemen, both Dutch and English, wore
European habits, to the lightness of which they paid little attention.
Nothing is more strange than that Europeans in hot climates should
<!-- Leaf 335, Page: 281 -->
submit.to the most oppressive sensations from a pertinacious
adherence to national clothing.


A visit to Buitenzorg, the country residence of Baron Van der
Capellan, gave us our only opportunity of seeing the beautiful scenery of
the island. Buitenzorg is distant about thirty miles south of Batavia,
is a thousand feet above the level of the sea, and is situated on the
banks of a torrent at the foot of the Sallak Mountain. The Sallak
of six summits rises to the height of six thousand feet, and is
covered with verdure to its highest pinnacle. The dense and
impervious vegetation clothing its steep declivities gradually unfolding
towards the base disclose the huts of the natives, planted on gentle
slopes, which are terraced into paddy fields, intersected with rivulets,
and skirted with groves. Boundless luxuriance and softness are the
leading features of Java scenery. Yet whilst the landscape is rarely
broken by bare and rugged rocks, it possesses all the grandeur
arising from lofty mountains, deep ravines, and rushing torrents, and
possesses in an eminent degree that picturesque character which is
peculiar to tropical countries, and results from the universal growth
of the palm tribe. Very often also it derives a character of the highest
sublimity from the tempests which visibly gather round the summits
of the mountains. In looking upon the Sallak, I have often watched
one of these grand natural spectacles which must be seen to be fully
appreciated. The Sallak stretches away nearly north and south,
losing its height at first abruptly, and then in gentle undulations.
A large dense, but broken cloud, rising gradually from the southern
limit, acquiring in its progress increasing magnitude, and sending
before it a faint breeze, usually announced the approach of a storm.
Soon becoming of the deepest black, it ascended to the summit of
the mountain, and incorporated with a thunder cloud that already
clothed it. Its volume thus increased assumed the form of a
stupendous crescent, the upper horn enveloping the front, the loAver,
the base of the mountain; whilst the landscape behind, seen through
its hollow, and still illumined by a brilliant sun, was distinctly visible.  
  
  
  o o
<!-- Leaf 336, Page: 282 -->
The extreme parts of the cloud then gradually approached, and
sending before them a rushing wind, closed the mountain from my
sight. Its upper part now suddenly increased in blackness, flashes
of lightning played within it, and it descended in heavy rain. Such
are the appearances which are almost daily witnessed amongst the
mountains of Java.


The temperature at Buitenzorg is never oppressive. At Cissarrhoa,
fourteen miles further inland, and at a higher elevation, the
thermometer, at ten o'clock on the morning of my visit there, stood at
sixty-six degrees; and at Japannus and at other places of still greater
elevation, it is generally so low, that the inhabitants use fires in the
morning the greater part of the year. A Dutch gentleman who resides
at Japannus, and to whom I had the pleasure of being introduced,
carried in his ruddy complexion and active form the best signs of
breathing a pure and temperate air. Yet this is the climate which has
been looked upon with so much horror by Europeans, and as far as
regards Batavia with justice. It is impossible to visit this city, and
not to be astonished at the infinite pains that have been taken to
unite in one spot all the possible causes of disease. It is built close
to the sea on a wet alluvial soil, is surrounded by swamps, and
intersected with nearly stagnant canals, the receptacles of all the
decomposing animal and vegetable matter ejected from the houses and
sewers on their banks. The carcasses of buffaloes and other animals
brought down by the rivers, are stqpped near the mouth of the
harbour by the extreme shallowness of the bar; and undergoing
putrefaction, contaminate the air around them. The houses are so
built as to admit very little ventilation, being closely packed together,
with their ends opposed to the sea and land breeze : indeed, so
afraid is a Dutchman of having his perspiration stopped by cool
air, that he closes all his doors and windows during its
prevalence. These circumstances in almost any climate would generate
disease, but must be dreadfully operative within six degrees of the
equator: their effects are aided by the use of large meals, strong
drink, and much sleep.
<!-- Leaf 337 -->
  
  CLIMATE. 233


That the causes of disease are strictly confined to the town of
Batavia, is proved by the circumstance of our troops having enjoyed
excellent health at Weltervreden, only three miles beyond it. Here
too the Embassy resided during seven weeks without experiencing
any illness of consequence, although they generally entered the town
two or three times a week. The diseases that fell under my care,
whilst in Java, generally yielded to the simplest remedies, and never
required the use of those powerful means which are thought
necessary to combat the disorders of hot climates. Whether the
indiscriminate use of mercury in almost every disease that calls for the aid
of medicine in Java, has not led to much mischief, appears to me
at least doubtful. As soon as symptoms of fever manifest themselves,
no attempt seems to be made to analyse its cause; " it is the fever,
and nothing can cure it but mercury." j Mercury is accordingly given
to an indefinite extent: if the patient live, " the fnercury cured
him;" if he die, " the disease killed him:" the remedy is never in
fault. We were glad to leave, however, the vicinity of a place that
had been the grave to many thousand Europeans, and embarked
in high spirits on board the Cæsar, a ship taken up for our
conveyance to England, on the morning of the 12th of April.


On leaving Java we carried on board with us tAvo animals of
interesting characters :—an immense snake, and an orang-outang. Of
the one I have already given some account, and shall refer the
description of the other to the concluding part of this work, as he
is too important a personage to be hastily dismissed; and to say all
that I wish about him in this place, would too long interrupt the
order of the narrative.


We left the island with prosperous weather, and had continued
on our voyage, accompanied by every favourable circumstance till
the morning of the 5th of May, when being about two hundred
miles to the south of the Mauritius, we were once more thrown into
great peril by the ship's taking fire. About seven in the morning
we were roused from our cots by violent shrieking, and the cries of
fire. The whole ship was instantly in dreadful confusion; the smoke  
  
  
  o o 2
<!-- Leaf 338, Page: 284 -->
pouring up in volumes from below, but coming from no
determinate point. In this frightful predicament the self-possession of
Captain Maxwell and his officers, and the promptness and courage of
the Alceste's crew, saved us from destruction. Captain Maxwell,
called from his cabin by the noise, instantly pointed out the duty of
each person. Lines were formed from the ship's sides for handing
buckets, and water was speedily at hand. " Where is the fire?"
asked Captain Maxwell of the mate of the vessel. " In the
spiritroom," was the whispered reply. " Mr. Holman*, ascertain the part
of the deck which is over the fire, and let the carpenter be in
readiness to scuttle it." Mr. Holman disappeared for a minute,
returned, and placing his foot on the plank, exclaimed, " Here's
the fire." In an instant the plank was cut aAvay, and the fire seen
raging beneath. Water was poured down in torrents, and in a few
minutes the glad intelligence, " The fire is out!" was heard in the
convincing tones of Captain Maxwell.


This danger past, Ave arrived safely in Simon's Bay at the Cape
of Good Hope, on the evening of the 27th of May.


* The gunner of the Alceste, not more remarkable for his coolness and courage in the
midst of danger, than for his intelligent and manly conduct in all his relations as an
officer. This tribute of praise springs less from the opinion of an individual unqualified
to judge his merits as a seaman, than from the universal testimony of his shipmates who
delight to tell of the merits of the gunner.
<!-- Leaf 339, Page: 285 -->
  
  CHAPTER XI.

During our former stay at the Cape, I made many observations on
the geological structure of its mountains, which, although
important, I did not relate in the former part of this work, with the
view of combining them Avith others made in our second visit.
I will now endeavour to detail both nearly in the order in which
they occurred; and in so doing shall take a general view of the
geological appearances that are displayed by the mountains most
accessible to a passing visitor at the Cape of Good Hope.


\"The three hills which terminate the peninsula (at the Cape) on
the north are, the Table Mountain, in the middle; the Lion's Head,
sometimes called the Sugar Loaf, on the west side; and the Devil's
Peak, on the east. The Lion's Head, which is about 2100 feet
high, is separated from the Table Mountain by a valley that descends
to the depth of fifteen hundred or tAvo thousand feet below the
summit of the Table Mountain, Avhich is itself 3582 feet above the
level of the sea. On the west of the Lion's Head, the ground, after
falling, rises again, forming an inconsiderable elevation, knoAvn by
the name of the Lion's Rump, from which the ground descends
gradually to the sea. The amphitheatre formed by these three
mountains, is about five or six miles in diameter, in the centre of
which is placed Cape Town."*


The walk which best exhibits many of the different facts visible
in these mountains, and which I am about to describe, lies through a
large chasm, called a Kloof, between Table Mountain and Lion's Head.  
  
  
  * Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, vol. vii. p. 271.
<!-- Leaf 340, Page: 286 -->
In pursuing this, I left Cape Town behind me, and having the Lion's
Rump on my right, and Table Mountain on my left, I advanced on a
road which soon became rugged from the action of the innumerable
streamlets, Avhich, during the rainy season, cut it up in every direction.
On first leaving the town, my way was over sand-stone, appearing to
be rather the debris of that which covers the tops of the surrounding
mountains than any regular formation, being composed of large
fragments loosely held together by an ochreous cement, or entirely
free; or, where a more regular appearance presented itself, the deep
ravines by which I occasionally passed, brought no strata to view.
Advancing onwards, I found the way covered with a loose soil
of various hues, composed partly of sand, containing rounded
fragments of quartz, and partly of a reddish clay, which seemed to be
the product of decomposed felspar. When about a mile from the
town, and at about two-thirds of the ascent up the ridge which
separates Table Mountain from the Lion's Head, I encountered
a scene which arrests the steps of every admirer of nature, and
has irresistible claims to the deliberate examination of the
geologist. The former delights in the fine contrast afforded by the
verdant slope of the Lion's Hill, and the silvery foliage of its
dazzling Proteas, when compared with the cavernous sides, shelving
rocks, and gloomy shades of the Table Mountain. The latter
dwells with curious eye and deep speculation on the evidences
of stupendous power and endless time every where surrounding
him; and equally exhibited by the unfathomable chasms worn in
the solid rock and by the hill-like masses of the mountains, which,
separated from their parent seat, threaten to sink with ruinous effect
from their elevated site. On recovering from the first impression,
his eye is attracted by the heavy grandeur of the Table Mountain;
and having slowly traversed the wide and sloping surfaces of
granite which deck its sides, pauses on the horizontal strata which
compose its summit. Whilst occupied in observing their exact
adjustment and even seams, he traces their direction towards his
right, till he finds them abruptly broken at that part where the great
<!-- Leaf 341, Page: 287 -->
chasm forming the kloof commences. Their appearance here so
much resembles an immense wall, a part of which has been
suddenly thrown down, that his eye necessarily wanders in search
of its opposite part; and it does not wander in vain. The Lion's
Head, similar in structure and appearance, instantly presents itself,
and forces the belief that at some period it has been continuous
with the Table Mountain, and that at another they have been
violently and at once disjoined.


Passing onwards, I soon reached the summit of the ridge
separating the Lion's Head from Table Mountain, and forming the
highest part of the road through the kloof, and obtained a
magnificent view of the sea. From this point the road turns suddenly
round the Lion's Head, and runs parallel to the Lion's Rump

owards the town. In this course it is for some way bounded on
one side by the granite which forms the base of the Lion's Head,
and on the other looks towards the sea, to which there is a rapid
declivity of some hundred feet.


Soon after commencing the descent from the ridge, I
encountered a singular appearance in the wall of granite which limits the
road on the right hand. It was a large vein or dyke passing through
the very heart of the rock. Both the granite and the vein were
much decomposed, and it was difficult at first to determine the
nature of the latter. I afterwards found it to consist of rounded
masses of basaltic rock imbedded in a soft yielding matter,
resembling decomposed granite. It has suffered the shift represented by
No. III. of the Geological Views at the Cape of Good Hope. Near
the spot where this occurred, an immense cleft in the mountain
exhibited a stratum of sandstone resting on a shelving surface of
granite, in an unconformable position and in so even a manner as
evidently to have been undisturbed since its formation. Both rocks
were so decomposed as not to afford good specimens, but appeared
to have no intervening bed between them, and to be distinctly

separate.

As I pursued my road, other and equally interesting appearances
<!-- Leaf 342, Page: 288 -->
presented themselves on the slope of the Lion's Head, over which
large masses of granite are piled one upon another, are grouped side
by side, or are scattered about in no definite manner. Some are
evidently unconnected with the rock beneath, but many appear to be
continuous Avith it. These rocks frequently exhibit large caverns,
formed either by the action of water on their surfaces, or by their
separation into different portions. Like the granite forming the base
of the Lion's Head, they are frequently traversed by large veins of
quartz. Beyond these, and near the margin of the sea, I observed
immense ridges of rock apparently of different colours, mingled
together. I hastened to visit them, in the hope of meeting Avith an
example of those instantiæ crucis on which different geological theories
are supposed to turn. In the descent leading to them I traced a vein
of small-grained red granite for upwards of thirty feet running through
the very large-grained granite which enters into the composition of
the neighbouring mountains. Passing over this, I walked upon
largegrained granite till I reached the sea. Then turning on my right,
and proceeding in a line with the Lion's Rump towards Cape Town,
I found masses of black rock buried in fields of granite. Still
advancing, I gained a spot in which there was an extraordinary junction
of granite and black rock, mixing together in such equal proportions
that it was impossible to say which predominated. A little beyond,
the black rock lay up in ridges from the sea into the granite; and
at length the granite disappearing, nothing but black rock was traced
lining the coast for a considerable distance. The range of coast where
these facts are visible, is known under the name of Green Point.


In re-examining these appearances with greater closeness, I
found the black rock, which I shall call schistus, uniformly in
vertical strata. On a diligent examination, a large vein appeared
passing through it, which, whether examined in its entire state or in
hand specimens, seemed to be made up of curved layers, and much
resembled fine-grained gneiss. This vein was very near a junction
of the schistus with the granite, which is encountered when the
Lion's Head bears about south by east. The granite was here

<!-- Leaf 345, Page: 289 -->
of a very small grain, and of a red colour, and full of vertical
seams filled with quartz, giving it the appearance of vertical
stratification. Immediately beyond, the schistus was so mixed up with
the granite, that it was difficult to determine whether the granite
entered the schistus or the schistus the granite; large veins of the
former appearing occasionally to enter the latter, and the contrary.
Passing on, I reached a spot in which the small-grained granite
spread in an extensive but thin sheet over the schistus; and I should
certainly have considered it as a rock of an indefinite thickness if a
large portion of it had not been broken away, and discovered the
schistus beneath it. This appearance is well represented in No. I.
of the Geological Views at the Cape of Good Hope.


The small-grained granite, from this interruption of its surface,
extended several yards, when 1 again came upon schistus studded all
over with large crystals of felspar. This porphyritic rock formed an
intervening body several feet in extent between the small-grained
granite and the commencement of another rock formed by an
intimate mixture of the large-grained granite with the schistus.
The wood cut very accurately represents a mass of this compound
rock, which was also several feet in extent.  
  
  
  p p
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P345_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 346, Page: 290 -->

Beyond it I still found the schistus mingling Avith the granite in
a large proportion, but not in the same confused manner. It rose
up from the sea and passed into the granite in large beds. These
were occasionally curved, and were most numerous near the sea,
and became narrower as I receded from it, and at length terminated
abruptly in the granite. Their appearance is faithfully shown in
the second number of the Geological Views of the Cape of Good
Hope. These beds Avere in some places traversed by veins of
largegrained, and in others, but less generally, by veins of the red
smallgrained granite.


In proportion as I advanced along the shore over the granite, the
schistus diminished in quantity, its beds becoming less wide and less
frequent, and taking the form of veins. At length it was only to be
seen in small detached masses buried in fields of granite. Pure
large-grained granite was afterwards alone visible.


Similar appearances to these having been seen by Captain Basil
Hall in Table Mountain, and described by him in the seventh
volume of the Edinburgh Philosophical Transactions, I took the
earliest opportunity, in the company of many friends, of
ascendingit, following the path pursued by that gentlemen.


Besides the examination of the mixture of schistus and granite, I
had two other objects in view; the one, to discover, if possible,
the mass of native iron which has so often been stated to exist on
the top of the mountain; the other to trace the junction of the
granite with the sandstone which rests upon it.


The first part of my road up Table Mountain was very easy,
being over a cart-way to a mill placed on a stream which flows
down a ravine in the face of the mountain which is opposite to
Table Bay. My way to this spot, about a mile and a quarter from the
town, was over a dark red sandstone deeply impregnated with iron.
Leaving the mill, I continued my ascent up the ravine by the side
of a torrent, whose course was interrupted by large fragments of the
different rocks which compose Table Mountain. The path soon
became difficult and steep, but the increasing interest of the scene

prevented the sense of fatigue. At not more than one hundred
yards from the mill, I first encountered any schistus which could be
considered as forming a component part of the mountain. It was so
much decomposed and so covered with the fragments of other rocks,
that I could determine little else about it than that even, at its Very
commencement, it had an intermixture of granite. Passing onward,
I found the bed of the torrent widening and less choked with
fragments, and exposing here and there large surfaces of schistus through
which granite was ramifying in every possible direction, and in the
most irregular shapes.


In one place I observed a broad vein of equal dimensions
throughout, traversing the whole exposed surface of schistus; in another,
a vein of equal breadth sending out large lateral branches,
sometimes straight, frequently very tortuous, and even twisted in their
course. Sometimes a vein commenced of great breadth, but
suddenly contracted in width, or dissipated in innumerable streamlets.
Similar appearances were visible in the wall of the ravine, to the
right hand of the spot Avhere I now stood, my face being towards
the mountain. In this Avail I observed broad perpendicular veins
of granite passing through schistus, in the manner represented by
No. V. of the Geological Views of the Cape. Advancing higher up,  
  
  
  p p 2
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P349_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 350, Page: 292 -->
  
  the proportion of the schistus to the granite increased, the latter

penetrating the former in less quantity, and frequently only in narrow
streaks. But the schistus occasionally changed its dark grey colour
for a lighter hue, and in these places, when fractured, resembled
gneiss. Still advancing, I reached the spot where the granite seemed
to rest on the schistus; the line of separation being very distinct,
but interrupted by zig-zag streams of granite which passed from the
great body of granite into the schistus.


Below the line of junction, a singular appearance was pointed out
to me by one of my companions. In a part of the schistus, of a
lighter colour than its principal mass, appeared two distinct portions
oftheir natural dark colour, at some distance from each other, but
having their opposite edges exactly corresponding. I discovered a
much more palpable phenomenon, of the same character, in a ravine
to the left of that in which I observed what I have just described.
Here a mass of schistus was divided by a vein of granite into two
portions, the vein passing through it in such a manner as to represent
the legs of a right angle, the apex of which was in the centre of the
schistus. In this instance also the two portions of schistus exactly
corresponded.
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P350_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 351, Page: 293 -->

looking up from a point rather below the principal line of
junction of the large body of the granite with the schistus, to the wall
of the ravine on my right, I observed large masses of schistus
imbedded in granite, and permeated by veins of the surrounding rock,
in the manner displayed by the fourth number of the Geological
Views at the Cape of Good Hope. These appearances, as well as that
before mentioned of the perpendicular veins of granite, are better
seen at some distance from the opposite side of the ravine, as they
are on too large a scale to be viewed nearly with advantage.


The veins of granite vary much in the size of their component
crystals. The large veins frequently resemble in all respects the
rock which gives them off; but the smaller veins are generally
of a smaller grain. In some instances veins commencing with the
characters of large-grained granite become of a less distinct character,
having at their termination a very small proportion of mica. Those
veins which are small-grained, and still more so those that are narrow
and twisted, are much harder than the surrounding granite. Their
surface rises above the level of the schistus, and is therefore less
acted upon by the water which flows over both, whilst the body
of granite appears to be more decomposable. They are also more
refractory to the hammer than the principal body of granite.


Leaving the line where the schistus communicates with the granite,
I continued my ascent over a great extent of the latter, presenting
a broad even slope, over which the water flowed in a clear current.
No schistus was now visible; nor did the fragments of any other
rock for several yards rest on the granite. At length the ravine
became more narrow; large masses of a very crystalline sandstone
began to appear, and I hoped soon to trace the junction of its
principal strata with the granite. But the channel of the torrent still
contracted, the fragments of sandstone became more frequent, and
at length so entirely hid the granite, that I could only conjecture
respecting their point of union. During my progress from this spot
to the summit of the mountain, I met with little that interested
me at the time, or that is worth relating. From the termination
<!-- Leaf 352, Page: 294 -->
of the granite, sandstone of different colours, first reddish, and
afterwards beautifully Avhite, and in exact horizontal strata, continued to
the top of the mountain. The most striking fact regarding this
sandstone formation is, that it contains, even when most highly crystalline,
rounded masses of quartz, from the size of a pea to that of a small

pear.

On reaching the top of the mountain, I was much gratified by

the strangeness of the scene that expanded around me. On my
left spread a plain covered with small fragments of rocks and a
great variety of hardy flowering plants. On my right its surface
was more unequal; the sandstone having yielded in some parts more
than in others to the action of the elements, had assumed the most
grotesque forms, exhibiting the appearance of ruined buildings,
amidst which were growing numbers of beautiful and interesting
ferns. Having recovered from the fatigue of the ascent, I
commenced a search for the mass of iron, in which I was seconded by
several friends, but our endeavours were fruitless; and although
repeated a few days afterwards, had no better success.


I may here observe, that there can be no doubt that a mass
of iron has existed on Table Mountain; I have conversed with
several persons at the Cape, who have either seen it themselves,
or have heard others mention it Avho have. But it is there
generally believed to be the fluke of an anchor, as mentioned by Mr.
Barrow*, and was described to me as such by the late Mr.
Gothorpe, master of the Alceste, who had examined it. An elderly
gentleman, who resides at Simon's Town, stated to Captain
Maxwell that he Avas one of a large party who many years ago carried
it up, with what motive it is perhaps not easy to imagine. It does
not, however, I apprehend, exist on the top of Table Mountain
at this time. A mass of iron, answering its description in every
respect, has lately been seen at some distance below, and is probably  
  
  
  * Travels in Southern Africa.
<!-- Leaf 353, Page: 295 -->
tumbled further down by every succeeding person who finds it. The
only iron which I met with in any part of Table Mountain was in
the form of red oxide, a vein of which I saw passing through the
sandstone when about two-thirds up the mountain.


My disappointment in not finding the union of the sandstone
and granite on Table Mountain was forgotten in the examination
of a very extensive junction pointed out to me by Captain Wauchope
in a mountain that faces the sea, in the neighbourhood of Simon's
Bay. I shall describe it in this place for the sake of connecting
those phenomena from which I shall attempt any conclusions
respecting the formation of the Cape mountains. The sandstone
forming the upper part of the mountain is of a reddish colour, very
crystalline in its structure, and approaching in some specimens to
quartz rock. Immediately beneath the sandstone is a bed of
compact dark red argillaceous sandstone, passing in many places into slate
of the same colour. This bed rests upon another of very coarse
loosely combined sandstone, resembling gravel. Under this is
another layer of dark red sandstone, terminating in a conglomerate,
consisting of decomposed crystals of felspar, and of rounded and
angular fragments of quartz from the size of a millet-seed to that
of a plover's egg, imbedded in a red sandstone base. Beneath the
conglomerate commences a bed, which I at first mistook for granite,
and which is composed of the constituents of granite in a
decomposed state, intermixed with green steatite, and a sufficient
quantity of the dark red sandstone to give it a reddish hue. The
felspar of this bed is decomposed, and exactly resembles that in the
conglomerate above it. The mica seems in a good measure to have
passed into steatite. The quartz is in small crystals, frequently
having their angles rounded. This bed is several feet in thickness,
and gradually terminates in granite, but the precise line of junction
I was unable to trace. The appearances then were in the following
order:  
  
  
  li Horizontally stratified sandstone.
<!-- Leaf 354, Page: 296 -->
  
  2. A bed of compact dark red sandstone passing into slate.
{empty}3. A bed of coarser sandstone, resembling gravel.


{empty}4. A second layer of compact dark red sandstone passing,

5thly, into a conglomerate, consisting of decomposed crystals of
felspar and fragments of quartz in a sandstone base.

{empty}6. A bed composed of the decomposed constituents of granite  
  
  
  and red sandstone, passing,  
  
  
  7thly, into granite.
But although the above is the general, it is not the universal order

of the appearances presented by the mountain. It sometimes
happens that one, sometimes two, and even more of the series are
wanting. In one place I found the horizontally stratified sandstone
resting on the coarser gravelly sandstone; in another on the
conglomerate; and in another on the bed below it. In fact, in different
places it came in contact with each of the series.


The beds of sandstone which pass into slate are altogether
different, both in colour and structure, from the sandstone forming
the top of the mountain : they are of a dark red colour, and very
earthy in their fracture; the other is of a reddish gray colour,
and crystalline in its fracture. Fragments of dark red slate
containing minute plates of mica, are imbedded in the coarse gravelly
sandstone.  
  
  
  The bed of coarse gravelly sandstone in some places exactly  
  
  
  resembles what has been called the old red sandstone conglomerate :

in it are found large and round fragments of quartz surrounded by
crystals of shorl.


I have now described, with all the accuracy of which I am capable,
the more general and important geological appearances which
presented themselves to my observation during my two visits to the
Cape of Good Hope. I have described them without attempting
to deduce conclusions from them whilst occupied in detailing them,
that I might give my reader an opportunity of forming his own
opinions respecting them unembarrassed by any theoretical
<!-- Leaf 355, Page: 297 -->
observations. I shall now, however, venture to state the explanation
Avhich occurred to me of some of the principal phenomena; in doing
which I shall be found to coincide in inferences already drawn from
the same class of facts. I may previously remark, that the same
structure which is found to belong to the mountains accessible from
their immediate vicinity to Cape Town, in all probability
characterizes those of the great ranges of Southern Africa. In an excursion
to a ridge of mountains, called the Jungerhook, about forty miles
north of Cape Town, I found the same general constituents of
sandstone, granite, and schistus, entering into their composition, wherever
I could examine them closely; and I saw no mountain whose summit
was not formed of horizontally stratified sandstone, and whose base
Avas not covered Avith fragments of schistus and granite. The
observations of Barrow and other travellers also show, that the
general structure of the mountains in the interior of Southern Africa
is the same as that of those in the neighbourhood of Cape Town.


My description of the appearances in Table Mountain will be
found to agree in most respects with that of Captain Basil Hall,
published and reasoned upon by Mr. Playfair in the seventh volume
of the Edinburgh Philosophical Transactions. The black rock
which I have called schistus, is there indifferently denominated
killas and grawacky. Without attempting to give it a definite
appellation, I shall describe such of its characters as I have been able to
determine. The Devil's Hill, Avhich is distinctly stratified, affords,
perhaps, the best specimens for ascertaining its nature; as this
mountain is intermediate between a coarse-grained rock on the one
hand, and slate on the other. The colour of the rock is a smoke
gray, with a reddish tint, which becomes deeper in proportion as the
rock is exposed to the weather. To the naked eye the rock has a
very fine granular appearance, with a glimmering lustre arising from
minute scales of mica. Under a lens a sandstone structure becomes
more distinct, and when the rock has been subjected to the heat
of a common stove, the quartz sand becomes predominant and
the conglomerate character unquestionable : this effect is probably  
  
  
  Q Q
<!-- Leaf 356, Page: 298 -->
the consequence of the contraction of a clay base. The schistus
Avith these characters has two extremes, one near its junction with
the granite, the other when most remote from it. Near the granite
it is distinctly granular to the naked eye; when most remote it
passes into slate. The slate which is to be seen in quarries in Lion's
Hill is intersected by narrow veins of quartz, and might be taken at
first sight for primitive clay slate, but is of a dark gray colour,
and contains scales of mica which, under a strong magnifier, give it
the appearance of mica slate: it is, however, thus viewed, distinctly
granular, and more so after exposure to heat. These are the leading
characters and gradations of the schistus of the Cape; I call it
schistus, because it is always distinctly stratified and has more or
less of a slaty fracture.


The theory of the igneous origin of granite adopted by
Captain Hall and Mr. Playfair to explain the phenomena visible in
Table Mountain, very happily meets the facts, and must appear,
I apprehend, to one standing on the spot where they occur, as
incontestible. * They are indeed of that nature which strikes the
conviction at the first glance. Carry to the spot one who never
heard of geological theories, and ask him what he infers from the
appearances before him, and he Avill exclaim, " The white rock has
broken the black in pieces." Whatever may be the true explanation
of the appearances, this I apprehend must be the first impression
that affects the mind of any person visiting Table Mountain. A


* " The penetration of the killas, or grawacky, by veins from the mass of granite which
it surrounds, proves that the killas, though the superior rock, is of older formation than
the granite. The granite, therefore, is a mineral that has come up from below into the
situation it now occupies, and is not one of which the materials have been deposited by the
sea in any shape, either mechanical or chemical. It is a species therefore of subterraneous
lava, and the progeny of that active and powerful element which we know, from the
history both of the present and the past, has always existed in the bowels of the earth."

the Cape, drawn up by Professor Playfair from Observations by Captain Basil Hall.—

more deliberate investigation, by a more cautious observer, would
also, I think, lead to similar conclusions. If he were one desirous to
explain all geological phenomena by the agency of water, and be
therefore disposed to consider the mixture of schistus and granite as
resulting from cotemporaneous formation, he would hesitate over
the imbedded masses of the former uncontaminated by their matrix,
and would be still more perplexed by the fact that they can be
separated without mixture. He would in vain seek in them those
instances of the wedging of one rock into the other, which has been
supposed confirmative of this opinion. * In looking at the principal
line of junction between the granite and the schistus, he would see no
gradual gradation of one into the other, but a distinct, though
interrupted line of separation. This interruption he would find to be
occasioned by veins of granite passing directly from the principal mass of
granite into the schistus; in other words, the subjacent rock shooting
into the superincumbent one. f Below this line he would indeed find
an intimate mixture of the two rocks, occasioning a compound of a
lighter colour than the schistus; such an appearance as might in itself
be explained on the supposition of coeval formation. But he would
meet a fact exceedingly unfavourable to this conclusion on a closer
view; he would see here, as in the granite, two pieces of schistus of


* " The substance of the vein is to be observed mixed with and passing into that of the
rock; and it wedges out in every direction in the mass of the rock, thus showing that it
has not been filled from above or below, but is, as it were, a secretion from the rock
itself. Such veins are denominated cotemporaneous, because they appear to have been
formed almost at the same time with the rock in which they occur."— Elements of
Geognosy, p. 23G.


f " It is an incontrovertible fact, that no veins of the substance ofa subjacent rock ever
shoot into a superincumbent one; because the structure of the crust of the globe, from
the oldest granite to the newest alluvial deposit, shows that veins are composed either of
the finer substance of the rock in which they are contained, as is the case with those veins
denominated cotemporaneous, or of substances more or less different from the rock,
and which are frequently connected with mountain-masses or beds that lie over those
rocks by which these veins are traversed. Thus no veins of granite are ever observed
shooting from the oldest granite formation into the superincumbent gneiss; but veins of
gneiss traverse through granite." — Elements of Geognosy, p. 237.  
  
  
  Q Q 2
<!-- Leaf 358, Page: 300 -->
the natural dark colour imbedded in the mixed mass, and if he
subjected them to the most accurate measurement, he would find
their edge and angles corresponding. If he should leave the Table
Mountain and visit Green Point, where the mixture of the two
rocks is more intimate, he would still have to contend with facts
scarcely explicable on the Neptunian theory. The appearance
most likely to arrest his attention, would be the intimate
intermingling of the two rocks in the large field, a portion of which is
represented in page 289., and which he would probably consider,
on a first view, not only explicable on the theory of aqueous
formation, but as favourable to it. Here he could see that intermingling,
and wedging, and gradation of one rock into the other, which his
opinions require. But this conclusion would perhaps give way to
a Avider view of the phenomena around him. The leading feature
stamped on all the facts at Green Point is exceeding commotion at
the period of the mixture of the two formations. To conceive that
they Avere deposited from a fluid in a state of rest, seems to me
impossible for any one crediting the evidence of sense. Although it
might perhaps be said, that their intimate mixture was the
consequence of the agitation of the fluid whilst they were crystallizing. But
supposing a Neptunian to have formed this inference, he must, I
apprehend, yield it to one of the conditions of his oavii theory, and one of the
laws of crystallization. * Bodies of a perfect crystalline structure can
only be formed as a chemical deposit from a fluid in a state of rest.
Rocks of an earthy fracture are formed from a fluid more or less
agitated. What then are the characters of the rocks at the point of


* " We know the conditions necessary for the formation ofa crystalline structure, and
that rest and motion are the agents which assist or prevent its regular formation. Hence
we may very fairly infer that the solution or ocean when it stood high over the earth was
calm and undisturbed. During succeeding periods the solution appears to have become
more and more agitated; yet at first it only prevented the perfection of the crystallization.
As the water diminished in height its motions increased; its destroying powers reached
to the surface of the earth and the crystalline shoots were destroyed, and thus the first
mechanical productions were formed." Elements of Geognosy, p. 90.
<!-- Leaf 359, Page: 301 -->
junction? Certainly not those which Avould result from a deposit
more or less mechanical. Their fracture is highly crystalline, and
more so in proportion to the vicinity of the granite.

On the other hand, one who adopts the theory of the igneous
origin of granite would find no difficulty in explaining all the
phenomena which present themselves; he would consider them, indeed,
as a beautiful illustration and a powerful confirmation of his
doctrine. Those instances, so puzzling to a Neptunist, of the detached
fragments of the rock Avhich overlies, and its penetration by veins
from below, and the crystalline fracture of the two rocks when
compounded, would appear to him necessary to the verification of his
opinions. That granite in fusion bursting through a superincumbent
rock should split it into an infinite variety of fissures, and fill them,
like melted metal poured into a mould, and should dislodge and
insulate fragments, is an inference too obvious to be much dwelt upon
in this place.


The beds of schistus represented in Plate N° 2,, as rising into the
granite, have on a first view so much the appearance of having
pushed through the granite, that it might be imagined that the
schistus had dislocated the granite rather than the granite the
schistus, if a more extended research did not show the latter
insulated in the former, and its strata vertical. But that the granite
overspreads the schistus near their point of junction, and that the
latter is not conformably deposited upon it, cannot, I think, be
doubted by any one who traces the appearances in their successive
order. In Avalking down to the sea, in the line of the principal
junction of the two rocks, you first cross over granite of a very large
grain unmixed with schistus for some distance, except that you
occasionally observe a small imbedded mass of the latter rock. On
approaching the beach you gradually find the granite altering its
colour, from mixture with schistus, and at length including large
beds; and Avhen you reach the shore Avhere the rocks are exposed to
all the power of the ocean, and more battered aAvay, the schistus
becomes less and less mixed, and is at length entirely pure. At thisspot,
<!-- Leaf 360, Page: 302 -->
on my first visit, I felt the fullest conviction that I distinctly traced
the main body of the schistus sweeping under the granite along the
margin of the sea; but on a second visit I could not verify my first
observation. On my first visit the day Avas cloudy and the sea quiet;
on my second, the sun shone bright, and was reflected by the breakers
of a troubled sea dashing against the rocks. This important fact,
therefore, still requires to be substantiated by other observations.


It is at the junction of the large-grained granite with the schistus
that any doubts can be felt by the sceptical whether the granite
overlies the schistus. No doubt can exist of the small-grained
granite being spread in a thin but extensive sheet over it, as
the breaking away of portions of this near its centre has exposed
the schistus beneath. But as small-grained granite has been
considered of later formation than the large-grained, this fact may be
considered of little importance. I would venture to observe, however,
respecting the formation of the small-grained granite at Green
Point, that it is impossible to avoid the belief that it is coeAral with
the large-grained; it passes so gradually into it in some places,
and is so indeterminately mixed with it in others, that the mind
seeks in vain for any other conclusion respecting it. Granting their
formation to have been cotemporaneous, it Avould not perhaps be
very difficult to explain their difference of character on the
Huttonian theory. It is, I believe, one of the acknowledged laws
regarding the crystallization of bodies from a state of fusion, that
their forms are more or less definite in proportion as the rate of
cooling is slow. If the granite in fusion burst through the schistus,
the greatest heat must have been at the point of junction near the
great body of granite; and here, therefore, the more perfect
crystalline forms should occur. The fact is consistent with the theory.
The component parts of the large-grained granite, when they
intermix with the schistus, retain their crystalline character, giving rise
to the porphyritic rock before described.


The sheet of granite, on the contrary, spreading in a thin layer
over the schistus, would cool with great rapidity and become a
<!-- Leaf 361, Page: 303 -->
granite of less distinct Crystalline characters; in other words, a granite
of smaller grain. In this view the small-grained granite at Green
Point might be considered in the condition of a vein from the
largegrained. The same explanation will go far to explain the different
charaters of the veins in Table Mountain. Those of the greatest
width, in some places entirely, and in all much resemble the rock
which gives them off. Those of a smaller or of a gradually
diminishing Avidth, are of a large grain at their origin, but become of a
smaller grain as they recede from it; that is, they are of a less definite
character Avhere, according to the theory of the igneous origin of
granite, they cooled with the greatest quickness.


But however well the condition of these rocks may be explained
by the agency of fire, the operation of water is no less plainly
pointed out by the horizontal strata of sandstone, and the
appearances attending its junction Avith the granite. Yet whilst the general
fact of the aqueous deposit of the great sandstone strata forming the
summits of the Cape mountains, and their undisturbed rest since,
cannot escape observation, it is a task of some difficulty to unravel
all the phenomena attending their junction Avith the granite. Having
endeavoured to point out their general order, I shall here venture
to suggest those consequences to which they seem to lead.


The appearance which, from its universality, especially presses upon
the notice, is the decomposed state of the constituents of granite,
whether forming the bed immediately resting upon granite, or a part
of the porphyritic conglomerate, resulting from their mixture with
red sandstone. Three principal conclusions may, I think, be drawn
respecting it. First, that the decomposition has not arisen from
any late action of the elements; secondly, that it occurred before the
deposition of the great sandstone formation; and, thirdly, that it
happened when the surface of the granite, in a greater or less
degree, formed the surface of the land.


That " the decomposition has not arisen from any late action of
the elements," is proved by the great compactness and toughness
of the rocks in which it occurs, and by the fact that granite in their
<!-- Leaf 362, Page: 304 -->
immediate vicinity, under equal or greater exposure, has suffered no
decomposition.


That " the decomposition occurred before the deposition of the
great sandstone formation," is the necessary consequence of the first
conclusion; for if the sandstone Avas deposited on the granite before the
decomposition of its constituents, whence could that decomposition
subsequently arise; how especially could crystals of quartz become
rounded, and how can be explained the formation of the
conglomerate? The appearance indeed speaks for itself; it is self-evident
that the surface of the granite was in a decomposed and disintegrated
state, when its constituents mixed up Avith dark red sandstone.


But if this decomposition and disintegration of the rocks
happened before the deposition of the sandstone, the hypothesis of
Capt. Hall and Mr. Playfair*, that the sandstone was deposited
upon the granite whilst at the bottom of the sea, and that it was
subsequently raised in so gradual a manner as to have kept its
relative situation with respect to the rocks on which it rests, can
scarcely be admitted. For the granite, according to this supposition,
must have been at that great depth, at which it belongs to no theory
to suppose that such changes on the surfaces of rocks can occur. On
the other hand, they are precisely those which we continually see
rocks undergoing that are exposed to the weather and the action of
torrents. Therefore the third conclusion respecting the appearances
I have described may perhaps be safely drawn; namely, that the
decomposition and disintegration of the granite occurred " when
its surface formed, to a greater or less extent, the surface of the
earth." And from this a necessary corollary follows; that thesand
* " The introduction of the granite into the situation it now occupies must have taken
place while the whole was deep under the level of the sea: this is evident from the
covering of sandstone which lies on the granite to the thickness of 1500 feet; for there can be
no doubt whatever that this last was deposited by water. After this deposition the whole
must have been lifted up, as Capt. Hall supposes, with such quietness and regularity, and
in so great a body, as not to disturb or alter the relative position of the parts." Account
of the Structure of the Table Mountain in the Edinburgh Philosophical Transactions.
<!-- Leaf 363, Page: 305 -->
stone was deposited by the sea rising to an incalculable height above
the granite. The phenomena attending the junction of the
sandstone with the granite agrees with this view of the subject, and
can be as satisfactorily explained on the Wernerian, as those
attending the junction of the granite and schistus can on the Huttonian
theory. The intermediate beds between the sandstone and granite
are of a coarse earthy fracture. The superincumbent sandstone, on
the contrary, becomes of a more crystalline structure in proportion
as it recedes from them. These two facts are obviously
conformable to the laws before quoted respecting the causes which
modify crystallization, or which are necessary to the formation of
rocks, by a deposit more or less mechanical. For the motion of
the sea, being greater near its surface than at a great depth, would
be chiefly influential in preventing any tendency to crystallization
when it first flowed over the granite; but as it rose much above
it, the subsequent deposits would be less agitated and acquire a
more crystalline character. One more remark respecting the
decomposed state of the constituents of granite may be made in this place;
namely, that from whatever cause they acquired this state, they have
not reassumed their crystalline forms, although subjected to enormous
pressure for an incalculable period.


The appearances, then, which I have described, and the
conclusions that I have ventured to draw, seem to point out four different
eras, corresponding to as many separate conditions of the rocks
constituting the peninsula of the Cape. The first, indefinite as to its
commencement, continued whilst the schistus reposed at the bottom
of the sea, and terminated when the granite in fusion burst through
it and formed dry land. The second commencing at this epoch,
terminated when the water rose above the granite. The third had its
duration whilst the water stood high above the earth and deposited
the sandstone. The fourth commenced with the retrocession of the
water and the appearance of the present dry land, and will terminate
with the existing order of things. Another consequence of the fact
that I have cited appears to be, that the mountains at the Cape of  
  
  
  R R
<!-- Leaf 364, Page: 306 -->
Good Hope exhibit phenomena illustrative and confirmative of certain
positions both of the Huttonian and Wernerian theories, but only
to be entirely explained by the agency of both the elements on
which the respective systems are founded.


I shall now mention one or two other mineralogical facts which
I noticed at the Cape, rather because any information respecting the
geology of a part of the world so little explored is desirable, than
because of their importance.


An excursion to Huyt's Bay was recommended to me for the
purpose of examining some curious stalactical formations. In the
company of Mr. Voicy, a gentleman to whom I owed many of the op^
portunities that I obtained of seeing the geological facts which I have
described, I set out for the mountain where they occur, and in my way
visited Great Constantia, interesting from being one of the two farms
producing the wine bearing its name. We were received with much
politeness by the manager of the estate, and conducted through the
vineyards, Avhich at that season of the year (June) exhibited only the
bare trunks and branches of the vine, resembling leafless gooseberry
bushes. From the vineyard we were led into the cellars, which had
nothing extraordinary in their appearance, unless it was their extreme
cleanliness and exact arrangement. From the cellars we were
conducted into the house to examine a very fine specimen of stalactite
Avhich had been brought from the neighbourhood of Cape Hanglip.
It was about ten feet high, tapering rapidly from its base, which
measured about thirty inches in circumference. The cave whence it was
brought abounds, it is said, in specimens of equal magnificence.
From Constantia it was necessary to pass over a ridge of
mountains, called the Steinberg, to reach Huyt's Bay. Our host
took some pains to persuade' us of the impracticability of passing
it on horseback; but as he did not speak from his own experience,
could not persuade us to forbear the attempt. We found the
road sufficiently difficult, and were perhaps the first equestrians who
attempted it, and would scarcely recommend any body to follow
our example. The Steinberg consists, like all the other Cape
<!-- Leaf 365, Page: 307 -->
mountains, of horizontal strata of sandstone resting on granite. In
passing over it, our attention was arrested by an immense vein of red
oxyde of iron, six feet wide, and which we traced for upwards of
one hundred feet.


Having crossed the Steinberg, we came within view of the
mountain which was the object of our visit; and when about a
quarter of a mile from it, reached a broad creek, formed by the
sea; and were on the point of entering its shallowest part, when
we were stopped by a man running towards us in great haste, and
calling out to us not to stir. On coming up, he told us that we
were on the verge of a quicksand, and directed us to take the
deepest part of the rivulet close to the sea, where, he said, is always
the firmest ground. Our friendly informant proved to be one of
the Dutch boors, and invited us to his house close by, on our return
from the mountain. Having crossed the creek, we were much
gratified with the appearances which the mountain exhibited; but were
prevented, by the apprehension of the flowing of the tide, from
examining them with all the attention that I wished.


The face of the mountain fronting the sea, had all the
appearance of a limestone rock; but when broken, proved a sandstone
precisely similar to that which forms the horizontal strata of
the rocks near Simon's Town, but was cased with a stalactical
deposition by water which constantly overflows it. We also found
in a deep ravine some beautiful examples of stalactite, formed by
a calcareous deposit on the fibrils of roots, penetrating the roofs
of small caverns worn in the rock. A floor of tabular stalactite
also covered the ground for several yards about the base of the
mountain, and beautiful imitations of moss produced by the splashing
of water falling from a great height, were also abundant.


I was unable to account for these appearances at the period of
my visit, as I could discover no limestone from which the water
could derive its calcareous impregnation. I have been since
assured that the top of the mountain is covered with a bed ofcomr r 2
<!-- Leaf 366, Page: 308 -->
minuted shell and sand: if this be the fact, their explanation is
obvious.


Other appearances of somewhat more difficult explanation were
discovered and pointed out to me by Captain Maxwell near Simon's
Town. Somewhat to the eastward of the town is a large bank,
which rises from the sea to the height probably of a hundred feet,
and seems to have been formed by an accumulation of shell and
sand brought up by the south-east wind. That such is the origin
of the bank, is probable from its being exposed to the direct
influence of this wind, and from its very loose structure. I at first
thought it possible that it might have resulted from the
decomposition of sandstone; but relinquished this opinion on finding
the fragments of shell extending much below the surface. On
this bank a great number of calcareous cylindrical bodies lie
scattered about, and at first sight resemble the bones of animals bleached
and disorganized by exposure to the air. On a closer examination
many of them are found to be branched; and others are discovered
rising through the soil, and ramifying from a stem beneath thicker
than themselves. Their vegetable origin immediately suggests
itself, and is confirmed by a further enquiry. They are seldom
solid, their centres being either hollow or filled Avith a blackish
granular substance, which in many specimens, except in colour,
much resembles the substance called roastone by mineralogists.
Their outer crust is chiefly composed of a large proportion of
sand, and a small proportion of calcareous matter, and in many
specimens contains fragments of ironstone, and quartz an inch
square. That they are really incrustations formed on vegetables
which have afterwards decayed, is proved by the different degrees
of change which the internal parts of different specimens have
undergone. In some the organization of the plant sufficiently
remains to leave its nature unequivocal, and near the sea the very
commencement of the process of incrustation may be witnessed on
the large Fuci Avhich strew the shore.
<!-- Leaf 367, Page: 309 -->

Similar bodies have been found by Vancouver, Flinders, and
Peron * on the shores of New Holland, at considerable elevations.
The two first-named travellers considered them all as coral, and as
proofs of the land having been lately withdrawn from the dominion of
the waters. The last has described two kinds of substances; the one
he considers coral, and the other as incrustations on vegetables. Of the
latter he gives ample descriptions, and explains the formation in a
manner which appears to be satisfactory, and to apply to the
substances found by Captain Maxwell near Simon's Town. He supposes
that the shells cast on the shore and submitted to the double influence
of an ardent sun and penetrating moisture, undergo a species of
chemical decomposition; and having lost a portion of their carbonic
acid, approach to the state of the lime used in some calcareous
cements, and in this state unite into a compost Avith quartz sand,
and form incrustations on the surfaces of plants. In another
passage he illustrates the steps of the process by a description of the
appearances of several specimens. " In breaking," he remarks, " the
branches of these species of Lythophytes, when the incrustation is
recent, we observe the woody texture contained in a solid case, and
without any remarkable alteration; but in proportion as the calcareous
envelope increases, the wood becomes disorganized, and changes
insensibly into a dry and black powder." From this state he supposes
the centre gradually to increase in solidity till the whole mass
becomes a mere sandstone, and nothing but an arborescent form
indicates the ancient state of vegetation,j

I have assumed that the incrustations near Simon's Town are of
a similar nature to those found in New Holland, because the
descriptions of authors correspond with the appearances I have witnessed,
and because I have compared a specimen from New Holland with
those I obtained at the Cape, and can trace no essential difference
either in their external characters or chemical composition. Peron
appears to have been the only one who has supposed any of the New
Holland specimens of vegetable origin; and even he considers the
calcareous bodies discovered on Bald Head and on the island of Timor,
in which they occur in large quantities at considerable elevations,
as really corals, but has not stated any reasons for his opinion,
beyond their general resemblance to those bodies. On Bald Head,
however, Captain Flinders discovered " two broken columns of stone,
three or four feet high, formed like stumps of trees, and of a thickness
superior to the body of a man;" appearances elsewhere found by
Peron, and described by him as being of vegetable origin.


In the hope of obtaining more precise information respecting the
nature of the Cape specimens than could be derived from their
external characters, I submitted them to the analysis used by Mr.
Hatchett* to determine the composition of different madrepores,

with the following results: When put into dilute nitric acid, a portion
of them dissolved with great effervescence, leaving a residuum of fine
sand of a white colour at the bottom of the vessel, covered by
a layer of brown flocculent matter. The supernatant liquor was
quite transparent. On treating this liquor with pure ammonia, no
precipitation took place.* Treated with carbonate of ammonia, it
threw down a white precipitate, which proved to be carbonate
of lime. The layer resting on the sand Avas dissipated by heat,
and burnt with the smell of vegetable smoke. The sand was
composed of grains of quartz. These were the general results of the
experiments, whether made with the outer coat or the interior
part of the substance. When the outer part of the crust was used,
the proportion of sand increased; when the inner part was used, the
dark-coloured flocculent layer increased. Subjected to the action of
the blowpipe in their entire state, these substances, under a gentle
heat, first blackened; at a higher heat threw off the smell ofa
vegetable smoke, and became perfectly white. From these
experiments it may, I apprehend, be deduced, that they consist of
carbonate of lime, quartz, and vegetable matter; a conclusion that
accords Avith the circumstances under which they are found, and
their frequent arborescent character. The New Holland
specimen, subjected to a similar analysis, gave precisely similar results.
As this specimen, for which I am indebted to Mr. Brown, who
brought it from Bald Head, has a remarkable resemblance to coral
both in form and closeness of texture, it may perhaps be considered
a fair example of those substances considered coral by Vancouver,
Flinders, and Peron. If this be admitted, it will follow that the
reasoning is incorrect which is founded on their supposed submarine
origin.


* This statement requires to be somewhat modified; for occasionally a little oxide of
iron was thrown down, arising from its mixture with the sand forming the crust, and
giving the supernatant liquor the colour of brandy.

The Embassy re-embarked on board the Cæsar on the 11th of
June. In rounding the Cape we were followed by numbers of
the huge albatross. The wings of one of the smallest of these
birds that hovered about the ship, and was taken in our
outwardbound voyage by Mr. D'Warris, an officer of the Alceste, measured
ten feet from one extremity to the other.
<!-- Leaf 371, Page: 313 -->
  
  CHAPTER XII.

Op St. Helena, where we arrived on the 27th, I have not much
to relate. The Embassy in visiting this island were chiefly desirous
to obtain an intervieAv with Napoleon, which being delayed, although
constantly expected, till the day before our departure, they had little
opportunity of examining its scenery. This is of a very peculiar kind,
and difficult to describe to those Avho have never visited a volcanic
country. It consists in a great measure of barren ridges, generally
bare but sometimes covered with a short grass, inclosing deep ravines.
The cabbage and the gum tree are almost the only arborescent plants
growing wild on the island; and the latter, in its hoary and abortive
look, seems formed to harmonize Avith its unattractive situation.
But if the island be defective in those natural beauties which belong
to a luxuriant vegetation, it is not devoid of picturesque views. The
ridges often rising to the height of fifteen hundred feet, are in some
places nearly perpendicular throughout, in others gently sloping, and
occasionally are covered with hillocks. Waterfalls often occur, and
gushing over the black surface of the rocks, are seen at a great
distance. In some favoured glens, villas surrounded by the vegetation
of all parts of the globe, are seen nestling amidst the surrounding
desolation.


Of these, Plantation House, the seat of the Governor, is
certainly the most attractive. It looks towards the sea, over a green
declivity, inclosed by two ridges of rock clothed with beautiful
pines. Amongst the innumerable plants that decked its grounds, I
distinguished the oak of Great Britain, the pine of China, and the
Avillow of New Holland, thriving in full and equal vigour. The
magnificent Ficus religiosus, the Canarium commune, the Cassuarinaequis s
<!-- Leaf 372, Page: 314 -->
setifolia, the Jatropha elastica, or India-rubber tree, the Croton
sebiferum, or tallow-tree, the Camellia oleifera and Japonica, the tea-plant,
and various species of Cassia and Mimosa grew in this enchanting
spot in all their native beauty. In fact, every quarter of the world
seemed to have afforded its choicest plants; and every plant to have
found a congenial soil and climate. Such a peculiar adaptation of
circumstances to the healthy growth of plants from all latitudes is
the probable consequence of the equal temperature which prevails
at the elevation of Plantation House, where the thermometer seldom
rises above 78° or falls below 66°. Thus the productions of hot
climates are not blasted by cold, nor those of the temperate zones
withered by heat.


The geological facts observable in St. Helena are not many, or of
very great importance. Those which generally present themselves
are the alternate beds of lava, which seem to constitute whole
mountains; and the immense perpendicular ridges of black rock, which
traverse like huge walls the Avhole extent of the island. The beds are
often exposed at the waterfalls, and exhibit a very definite, and,
as far as I could trace, un deviating order. In a waterfall near
the Friar's Ridge I had a good opportunity of examining them. A
face of rock about a hundred feet in height was made up of successive
beds in the folloAving order: the loAvermost was composed of a
red ochreous clay of considerable depth; resting upon this, and
passing into it, was a bed of light porous lava in fragments; on this
rested a bed of compact lava, scarcely at all porous, and passing into
a superincumbent bed of very compact dark-coloured rock, not
distinguishable from basalt.  
  
  
  o


The Friar's Ridge owes its name to several masses of rock,
which, piled on each other to the height of about twenty feet, rest
insulated on its top, and seen from beloAv have the appearance
of a monk enveloped in his cowl: a stranger often mistakes them
for a man standing on its summit. On a near approach they seem
to alter their form, and strikingly represent a gipsey with a child
at her back. On a close examination they are found to consist of
<!-- Leaf 373, Page: 315 -->
rhomboidal masses of the same rock which constitutes the ridge.
This rock is basalt, every where divided into columnar distinct
concretions. Those which I examined were pentagonal, about a foot
long, fitting each other with exact adjustment, and forming by their
aggregation very perfect columns. The ridge would perhaps be
called an enormous whin dyke. On one side it looks into a valley,
which has received the homely but significant appellation of "
Breakneck Valley;" and a more frightful uninterrupted precipice of fifteen
hundred feet cannot be imagined. The other side, by which it is
ascended, is of less abrupt declivity, and not more than five or six
hundred feet above the level of the bottom of the ravine formed
between it and a ridge of lower elevation. The ravine gradually slopes
towards the sea, and often increases in depth in a very abrupt
stairlike manner. Perpendicular faces thus appear, which exhibit the
successive beds of clay and lava which I have already described.


Of our interview with Napoleon I have little to tell. Excepting
Lord Amherst and Mr. Ellis, who were admitted to separate
audiences, the members of the Embassy were not in his presence more
than a quarter of an hour. Our reception was as stately as
circumstances admitted. A servant in the livery of Napoleon when in the
zenith of glory, stood like the phantom of former splendour to
receive us at the door of the outer apartment. Conducted by
Bertrand, we were received in an anti-room by Count Montholon
and General Gourgaud, both young men of interesting appearance.
Lord Amherst was immediately ushered by Bertrand into an inner
apartment to the presence of Buonaparte. An hour having elapsed,
Mr. Ellis was introduced, and in less than half an hour afterwards
the remainder of the party was admitted. A circle being formed
about Napoleon, he walked round, addressing successively each
person on some subject connected with his particular pursuit or
situation in the Embassy, and gave a neat and complimentary turn to
all his remarks. His object was evidently to please as much as
possible, and he certainly succeeded. But had we left the island without  
  
  
  s s 2
<!-- Leaf 374, Page: 316 -->
knowing that he had obtained a list of the persons of the Embassy,
and of their particular situations in it, previously to our introduction
to him, we should have gone away with a much higher opinion of
his address in conforming the subject of his conversation to
individual characters.


Buonaparte's person had nothing of that morbid fulness which I
had been led to look for. On the contrary, I scarcely recollect to
have seen a form more expressive of strength and even of vigour. It
is true that he Avas very large, considering his height, which is about
five feet seven inches; but his largeness had nothing of umvieldiness.
The fine proportion of his limbs, which has been often noticed, Avas
still preserved. His legs, although very muscular, had the exactest
symmetry. His Avhole form, indeed, Avas so closely knit, that firmness
might be said to be its striking characteristic. His standing posture
had a remarkable statue-like fixedness about it, wtfcfe seemed scarcely
to belong to the graceful ease of his step. The most remarkable
character of his countenance Avas, to me, its variableness. Buonaparte
has the habit of earnestly gazing for a few seconds upon the person
whom he is about to address; and whilst thus occupied holds his
features in perfect repose. The character of his countenance in this
state, especially when viewed in profile, might be called settled
design. But the instant that he enters into conversation his
features express any force or kind of emotion with suddenness and
ease. His eye, especially, seems not only to alter its expression,
but its colour. I am sure, had I only noticed it Avhile the muscles
of the face, and particularly of the forehead, were in play, I should
have called it a very dark eye; on the contrary, when at rest, I had
remarked its light colour and peculiar glary lustre. Nothing, indeed,
could better prove its changeable character than the difference of
opinion which occurred amongst us respecting its colour. Although each
person of the Embassy naturally fixed his attention on Napoleon's
countenance, all did not agree on the colour of his eyes.  
  
  
  There was nothing in the appearance of Buonaparte which led us
<!-- Leaf 375 -->
  
  -ASCENSION. 3] 7

to think that his health had at all suffered from his captivity. On
the contrary, his repletion seemed to be the consequence of active
nourishment. His form had all that tone, and his movement all that
elasticity, which indicate and spring from powerful health. Indeed,
whatever sympathy we felt for the situation of any of the prisoners,
received no increase from any commiseration for their bodily
sufferings : they Avere all in excellent plight.

On the morning of the 29th, the day after our interview Avith
Napoleon, Ave took leave of St. Helena, and on the 7th of July
made the island of Ascension.


After leaving St. Helena we imagined that no coast could appear
comparatively barren; but found the island of Ascension still more
dreary. On approaching the former, a speck of green here and there
relieved the prevailing sterility; but the shores of the latter only
exhibited hills formed of red volcanic ash, and columnar masses of
black lava rising through it.


A half hour's visit to the island was my only opportunity of
observing its interesting characters. I landed amidst some large rocks
of vesicular lava, which projected from a sandy beach into the sea.
Passing on tOAvards one of the red conical hills, I found lava in
distinct blocks, and ridges, every where pushing through the surface.
The more compact, of a very basaltic character, contained crystals of
olivine. The more vesicular had crystals resembling zeolite. The
surface of the hill was composed of small masses of a red and very
friable cinder, resting on a powder of the same substance. A short
distance up its acclivity, two white bodies, not a little puzzling when
seen at a distance, seem to rise through the soil. On examination
they proved to be tombstones, erected to the memory of two seamen
who had died in their vessels off the island. These stones were
curious from being sonorous, and having been formed from
considerable beds, or rather slabs of stone, found on the beach, and which
are formed of the fragments of shells cohering together. They
exactly resemble, except in being of a coarser grain, the rock in
which the human skeletons of Guadaloupe have been found.
<!-- Leaf 376, Page: 318 -->

Several varieties of obsidian and pitchstone are found on the island
in great quantities, but I could not learn under what circumstances.*

I found only one plant in my Avalk, a species of Euphorbia. On the
higher hills plants grow in sufficient abundance to feed many goats.

Turtle frequent the island from February to July, and are of large
size. Those taken on board the Cæsar weighed from two to four
hundred weight. The chief means of subsistence are goats, turtle,
and fish. Attempts have been made to raise vegetables on the
hills, but they have had little success in consequence of the rats with
which the island abounds.


Since the detention of Buonaparte the island has been fortified by
a battery of fourteen guns erected on a projecting rock; and the Spy
sloop, at the period of our visit, had been for a long time at anchor
to leeward of the island.


The Cæsar made sail early in the afternoon, and continued on her
voyage to England.


Our impatience to finish the remainder of our voyage, greater
in proportion as we approached its termination, was much lessened by
the amusement we derived from watching the habits of our shipmate,
the Orang-Outang. This animal, although described by Edwards \,
Vosmaer|, Buffon §, Camper||, F. CuvierU, Tillesius**, and others,
has not yet been so distinctly and fully pourtrayed either in his
external characters or peculiar habits, as to render all further


* The obsidian, which is most abundant, and of which I obtained specimens from an
officer stationed on the island, is of a velvet black colour, and of a perfect vitreous lustre.
Under the blowpipe it intumesces greatly, loses its black colour, and passes into a white
porous mass. Its specific gravity is 2.312. The pitchstone becomes of a darker colour
under the blowpipe, and porous on the surface, but melts into a slag with great difficulty.
Its specific gravity is 2.4.

account of him either uninteresting or unnecessary. The causes of
the defectiveness of these descriptions have been the youth of the
animals which have arrived in Europe alive, and the short time they
have survived after reaching the observation of those competent to
give a history of their habits. A cause of a similar kind will render
my observations of the one now in England less valuable than they
would be at a future period, when the animal shall have obtained,
beyond dispute, his full stature, and the entire developement of his
intellectual poAvers. But as a description of his external characters,
his dimensions, and intellectual manifestations at the present time,
will serve as a standard of comparison on a future occasion, and
because his actions on board ship were less restained, and therefore
more natural, than since his arrival in England, I shall make no further
apology to my reader for introducing in this place a description which
may seem to be little connected with the main object of this work.


For the possession of this rare animal the scientific world is
indebted to Captain Methuen, who brought him from
Banjarmassing on the south coast of Borneo, to Java; and in the hope of
aiding the cause of science placed him in my possession, for the
purpose of being conveyed to England. The natives informed
Captain Methuen that he had been brought from the highlands of
the interior, and that he was very rare, and difficult to take; and they
evidently considered him a great curiosity, as they flocked in crowds
to see him.


It may be necessary to acquaint some of my readers that the
OrangOutang of Borneo has been confounded by many writers with an
animal that inhabits Africa, and which has also been called
OrangOutang, but is more correctly known by the name of Pongo. The
Pongo, which has been minutely described by Tyson*, differs
anatomically from the subject of this description, and in having large
ears and black hair.


* Anatomy of a Pygmy compared with that of a Monkey, an Ape, and a Man, by
Edward Tyson, M.D. F.R S. 2nd ed. London, 1751.
<!-- Leaf 378, Page: 320 -->

Orang-Outang* is a Malay phrase, signifying "wild man," and,
should therefore be restricted to the animal, which, according to our
present information, is found exclusively on Borneo. The portrait in
the next page will give a correct notion of his general characters, and
assist the description. It was taken soon after his arrival in this
country, when his hair was longer than it now is in consequence of a
disease in the skin.


The present height of the animal, judging from his length when
laid on a flat surface, and measured from his heel to the crown of
his head, is tAvo feet seven inches.


The hair of the Orang-Outang is of a brownish red colour, and
covers his back, arms, legs, and outside of his hands and feet. On
the back it is in some places six inches long, and on his arms five.
It is thinly scattered over the back of his hands and feet, and is very
short. It is directed downwards on the back, upper arm and legs,
and upwards on the fore arm. It is directed from behind forwards
on the head, and inwards on the inside of the thighs. The face has
no hair except on its sides, somewhat in the manner of whiskers, and
a very thin beard. The middle of the breast and belly was naked on
his arrival in England, but has since become hairy. The shoulders,
elbows, and knees, have fewer hairs than other parts of the arms and
legs. The palms of the hands and feet are quite naked.


The prevailing colour of the animal's skin, when naked or seen
through the hair, is a bluish gray. The eyelids and margin of the
mouth are of a light copper colour. The inside of his hands and
feet are of a deep copper colour. Two copper-coloured stripes pass
from the armpits doAvn each side of the body as low as the navel.


The head viewed in front, is pear-shaped, expanding from the
chin upwards, the cranium being much the larger end. The eyes
are close together, of an oval form, and dark brown colour. The

117eyelids are fringed with lashes, and the lower ones are sacfidar
and. wrinkled. The nose is confluent with the face, except at the
nostrils, which are but little elevated : their openings are narrow and
oblique. The mouth is very projecting, and of a roundish
mammillary form. Its opening is large, but when closed is marked by little
more than a narrow seam. The lips are very narrow, and scarcely
perceptible when the mouth is shut. The chin projects less than the
mouth : beloAv it, a pendulous membrane gives the appearance of
a double chin, and swells out when the animal is angry or much
pleased. Each of the jaws contains twelve teeth, namely, four
incisive teeth, the two middle ones of the upper jaw being twice the
width of the lateral; two canine, and six double teeth. The ears
are small, closely resemble the human ear, and have their loAver
margins in the same line with the external angles of the eyes.


The chest is wide compared with the pelvis: the belly is very
protuberant. The arms are long in proportion to the height of the
animal, their span measuring full four feet seven inches and a half.
The legs are short compared with the arms.


The hands are long, compared with their width, and with the
human hand. The fingers are small and tapering : the thumb is
very short, scarcely reaching the first joint of the fore finger. All
the fingers have very perfect nails of a blackish colour and oval
form, and exactly terminating with the extremities of the fingers.
The feet are long, resemble hands in the palms, and in having
fingers rather than toes, but have heels resembling the human. The
great toes are very short, are set on at right angles to the feet
close to the heel, and are entirely without nails.*


* In the month of September, 1817, I took the dimensions of some of the parts of this
animal, but under circumstances in which I could not make them very numerous.
I have thought it proper to exhibit them, in conjunction with others taken on the 28th of
May, 1813: —

His head leaning forward, and forming a considerable angle with the
back, throws the centre of gravity so far beyond the perpendicular,
that his arms, like the fore-legs of other animals, are required to
support the body. So difficult indeed is it for him to keep the upright
position for a few seconds, under the direction of his keeper, that he
is obliged, in the performance of his task, to raise his arms above his
head, and throw them behind him to keep his balance. His
progressive motion on a flat surface is accomplished by placing his bent
fists upon the ground and drawing his body between his arms:
moving in this manner, he strongly resembles a person decrepid in
the legs, supported on stilts. In a state of nature, he probably seldom
moves along the ground; his whole external configuration showing
his fitness for climbing trees and clinging to their branches. The
length and pliability of his fingers and toes enable him to grasp
with facility and steadiness; and the force of his muscles empowers
him to support his body for a great length of time by one hand
or foot. He can thus pass from one fixed object to another, at the
distance of his span from each other, and can obviously pass from
one branch of a tree to another, through a much greater interval.
In sitting on a flat surface, this animal turns his legs under him in
the manner expressed by the engraving. In sitting on the branch
of a tree or on a rope, he rests on his heels, his body leaning forward
against his thighs. This animal uses his hands like others of the
monkey tribe.


It is necessary to remark, that I cannot answer for the precise accuracy of the annexed
measurements, as the restlessness of the animal and the fear of injuring him by violent
coercion, rendered it very difficult to take them. Those made indeed in May, 1818, were
often repeated, and are therefore no doubt close approximations to the truth.


This animal had, on his arrival in England, only ten teeth in each jaw. In December
he cut his two hindmost double teeth, making up twelve in each jaw. In December,
1817, he weighed thirty-five pounds and a half; in May, 1818, he weighed forty-three,
having increased seven pounds and a half in five months, and having grown, as may be
seen by the table, full three inches in height.

The orang-outang, on his arrival in Java from Batavia, was allowed
to be entirely at liberty till within a day or two of being put on board
the Cæsar to be conveyed to England; and whilst at large, made no
attempt to escape; but became violent when put into a large railed
bamboo cage for the purpose of being conveyed from the island.
As soon as he felt himself in confinement, he took the rails of the
cage into his hands, and shaking them violently endeavoured to
break them in pieces; but finding that they did not yield generally,
he tried them separately, and having discovered one weaker than the
rest, Avorked at it constantly till he had broken it, and made his
escape. On board ship an attempt being made to secure him by a
chain tied to a strong staple, he instantly unfastened it, and ran off
with the chain dragging behind; but finding himself embarrassed by
its length, he coiled it once or twice, and threw it over his shoulder.
This feat he often repeated, and when he found that it would not
remain on his shoulder, he took it into his mouth.


After several abortive attempts to secure him more effectually, he
was allowed to wander freely about the ship, and soon became familiar
with the sailors, and surpassed them in agility. They often chased
him about the rigging, and gave him frequent opportunities of
displaying his adroitness in managing an escape. On first starting, he
would endeavour to outstrip his pursuers by mere speed, but when
much pressed, elude them by seizing a loose rope, and swinging
out of their reach. At other times he would patiently wait on the
-shrouds or at the mast-head till his pursuers almost touched-him,
and then suddenly lower himself to the deck by any rope that
was near him, or bound along the main-stay from one mast to the
other, sAvinging by his hands, and moving them one over the
other. The men would often shake the ropes by which he clung
with so much violence as to make me fear his falling, but I soon
found that the power of his muscles could not be easily overcome.
When in a playful humour, he would,often swing within arm's
length of his pursuer, and having - struck him with his hand, throw
himself from him.
<!-- Leaf 385, Page: 325 -->

Whilst in Java, he lodged in a large tamarind-tree near my
dwelling; and formed a bed by intertwining the small branches
and covering them with leaves. During the day, he would lie
with his head projecting beyond his nest, watching Avhoever might
pass under, and when he saw any one with fruit, Avould descend to
obtain a share of it. He always retired for the night at sun-set, or
sooner if he had been well fed; and rose with the sun, and visited
those from whom he habitually received food.


On board ship he commonly slept at the mast-head, after wrapping
himself in a sail. In making his bed, he used the greatest pains
to remove every thing out of his Avay that might render the surface on
which he intended to lie uneven; and having satisfied himself Avith
this part of his arrangement, spread out the sail, and lying down
upon it on his back, drew it over his body. Sometimes I
pre-occupied his bed, and teazed him by refusing to give it up. On these
occasions he would endeavour to pull the sail from under me or
to force me from it, and would not rest till I had resigned it. If
it was large enough for both, he would quietly lie by my side. If
all the sails happened to be set, he would hunt about for some
other covering, and either steal one of the sailors' jackets or shirts
that happened to be drying, or empty a hammock of its blankets.
Off the Cape of Good Hope he suffered much from a low
temperature, especially early in the morning, when he would descend
from the mast, shuddering with cold, and running up to any one of
his friends, climb into their arms, and clasping them closely; derive
warmth from their persons, screaming violently at any attempt to
remove him.


His food in Java was chiefly fruit, especially mangostans, of which
he was excessively fond. He also sucked eggs with voracity, and
often employed himself in seeking them. On board ship his diet
was of no definite kind. He ate readily of all kinds of meat, and
especially raAV meat; was very fond of bread, but always preferred
fruits when he could obtain them.  
  
  
  His beverage in Java Avas water; on bbard ship, it was as
<!-- Leaf 386, Page: 326 -->
diversified as his food. He preferred coffee and tea, but would readily
take wine, and exemplified his attachment to spirits by stealing the
Captain's brandy-bottle: since his arrival in London, he has
preferred beer and milk to any thing else, but drinks wine and other
liquors.


In his attempts to obtain food, he afforded us many opportunities
of judging of his sagacity and disposition. He was always very
impatient to seize it when held out to him, and became passionate when it
was not soon given up; and would chase a person all over the ship
to obtain it. I seldom came on deck without sweetmeats or fruit in
my pocket, and could never escape his vigilant eye. Sometimes I
endeavoured to evade him by ascending to the mast-head, but was
always overtaken or intercepted in my progress. When he came up
with me on the shrouds, he would secure himself by one foot to the
rattling, and confine my legs with the other, and one of his hands,
whilst he rifled my pockets. If he found it impossible to overtake
me, he would climb to a considerable height on the loose rigging,
and then drop suddenly upon me. Or if, perceiving his intention,
I attempted to descend, he would slide down a rope and meet
me at the bottom of the shrouds. Sometimes I fastened an
orange to the end of a rope, and lowered it to the deck from the
mast-head; and as soon as he attempted to seize it, drew it rapidly
up. After being several times foiled in endeavouring to obtain it
by direct means, he altered his plan. Appearing to care little about
it, he would remove to some distance, and ascend the rigging very
leisurely for some time, and then by a sudden spring catch the rope
which held it. If defeated again by my suddenly jerking the rope,
he would at first seem quite in despair, relinquish his effort, and
rush about the rigging, screaming violently. But he would always
return, and again seizing the rope, disregard the jerk, and allow it
to run through his hand till within reach of the orange; but if again
foiled, would come to my side, and taking me by the arm, confine it
whilst he hauled the orange up.  
  
  
  This animal neither practises the grimace and antics of other
<!-- Leaf 387, Page: 327 -->
monkeys, nor possesses their perpetual proneness to mischief.
Gravity approaching to melancholy, and mildness, were sometimes
strongly expressed in his countenance, and seem to be the
characteristics of his disposition. When he first, came amongst strangers,
he would sit for hours with his hand upon his head, looking pensively
at all around him; or when much incommoded by their
examination, would hide himself beneath any covering that was at hand. His
mildness was evinced by his forbearance under injuries, which were
grievous before he was excited to revenge; but he always avoided
those who often teazed him. He soon became strongly attached to
those who kindly used him. By their side he was fond of sitting; and
getting as close as possible to their persons, would take their hands
between his lips, and fly to them for protection. From the
boatswain of the Alceste, who shared his meals with him, and Avas
his chief favourite, although he sometimes purloined the grog and
the biscuit of his benefactor, he learned to eat with a spoon; and
might be often seen sitting at his cabin-door enjoying his coffee,
quite unembarrassed by those who observed him, and with a
grotesque and sober air that seemed a burlesque on human nature.


Next to the boatswain, I was perhaps his most intimate
acquaintance. He Avould always follow me to the mast-head, whither I
often went for the sake of reading apart from the noise of the ship;
and having satisfied himself that my pockets contained no eatables,
would lie down by my side, and pulling a topsail entirely over him,
peep from it occasionally to watch my movements.


His favourite amusement in Java was in swinging from the branches
of trees, in passing from one tree to another, and in climbing over
the roofs of houses; on board, in hanging by his arms from the
ropes, and in romping with the boys of the ship. He would
entice them into play by striking them with his hand as they passed,
and bounding from them, but allowing them to overtake him and
engage in a mock scuffle, in which he used his hands, feet, and
mouth. If any conjecture could be formed from these frolicks of
his mode of attacking an adversary, it would appear to be his first
<!-- Leaf 388, Page: 328 -->
object to throw him down, then to secure him with his hands and
feet, and then "wound him with his teeth.

- Of some small monkeys on board from Java he took little notice,
whilst under the observation of the persons of the ship. Once
indeed he openly attempted to throw a small cage, containing three
of them, overboard; because, probably, he had seen them receive
food of which he could obtain no part. But although he held so
little intercourse with them Avhen under our inspection, I had reason
to suspect that he was less indifferent to their society when free from
our observation; and was one day summoned to the top gallant yard
of the mizen-mast to overlook him playing with a young male
monkey. Lying on his back, partially covered with the sail, he for some
time contemplated, with great gravity, the gambols of the monkey
which bounded over him; but at length caught him by the tail, and
tried to envelope him in his covering. The monkey seemed to
dislike the confinement, and broke from him, but again renewed its
gambols, and although frequently caught, always escaped. The
in^tercourse however did not seem to be that of equals, for the
orangoutang never condescended to romp with the monkey as he did with
the boys of the ship. Yet the monkeys had evidently a great
predilection for his company; for whenever they broke loose, they took their
way to his resting-place, and were often seen lurking about it, or
creeping clandestinely towards him. There appeared to be no
gradation in their intimacy; as they appeared as confidently familiar
with him when first observed as at the close oftheir acquaintance.


But although so gentle when not exceedingly irritated, the
orangoutang could be excited to violent rage, which he expressed by
opening his mouth, showing his teeth, seizing and biting those who
were near him. Sometimes indeed he seemed to be almost driven
to desperation; and on two or three occasions committed an act,
which, in a rational being, would have been called the threatening of
suicide. If repeatedly refused an orange when he attempted to
take it, he would shriek violently and swing furiously about
the ropes; then return and endeavour to obtain it; if again refused,
<!-- Leaf 389, Page: 329 -->
he would roll for some time like an angry child upon the deck,
uttering the most piercing screams; and then suddenly starting
up, rush furiously over the side of the ship, and disappear. On
first witnessing this act, we thought that he had thrown himself into
the sea; but on a search being made, found him concealed under the
chains.


I have seen him exhibit violent alarm on two occasions only,
when he appeared to seek for safety in gaining as high an elevation
as possible. On seeing eight large turtle brought on board, whilst
the Cæsar was off the Island of Ascension, he climbed with all
possible speed to a higher part of the ship than he had ever before
reached; and looking down upon them, projected his long lips into
the form of a hog's snout, uttering at the same time a sound which
might be described as between the croaking of a frog and the
grunting of a pig. After some time he ventured to descend, but
with great caution, peeping continually at the turtle, but could not
be induced to approach within many yards of them. He ran to the
same height and uttered the same sounds on seeing some men bathing
and splashing in the sea; and since his arrival in England, has shown
nearly the same degree of fear at the sight of a live tortoise.


Such were the actions of this animal, as far as they fell under my
notice during our voyage from Java; and they seem to include most of
those which have been related of the orang-outang by other observers.
I cannot find, since his arrival in England, that he has learnt to
perform more than two feats which he did not practise on board ship,
although his education has been by no means neglected. One of
these is to walk upright, or rather on his feet, unsupported by his
hands; the other, to kiss his keeper. I have before remarked with
how much difficulty he accomplishes the first, and may add, that a
well-trained dancing dog would far surpass him in the imitation of the
human posture. I believe that all the figures given of orang-outangs
in an unpropped erect posture, are wholly unnatural. Some writer
states, that an orang-outang which he describes gave " real kisses;"  
  
  
  u u
<!-- Leaf 390, Page: 330 -->
and so words his statement, that the reader supposes them the
natural act of the animal. This is certainly not the case with the
orang-outang which I have described. He imitates the act of kissing
by projecting his lips against the face of his keeper, but gives
them no impulse. He never attempted this action on board ship,
but has been taught it by those who now have him in charge.


I shall enter into no speculation respecting his intellectual powers,
compared with those of men; but leave the foregoing account of his
actions as a simple record of facts, that may be used by other
observers to estimate the rank which he holds in the scale of
sagacity. In the Appendix I have made a few observations on. the
histories given of the orang-outang by different writers.


After leaving Ascension, a favourable wind carried us rapidly to
the end of our voyage. We made the Scilly Rocks on the afternoon
of the 15th, and the several head-lands of the channel on the
following day. Towards the evening the weather becoming hazy, and
no pilot appearing, it was deemed unsafe to attempt reaching the
anchorage at Spithead before the next morning. During the night
the wind suddenly shifted two points, and blew fresh from the
westward, and soon increased to a gale that shivered our mainsail and
main-top sail, and carried away our mizen topsail yard. At
daylight, we found ourselves about ten miles to windward of the Isle
of Wight; and being soon after boarded by a pilot, we anchored by
eight o'clock at Spithead, and by ten were safely landed on our
native shores.

Jdelieving that I may tend to prevent the Ipecacuanha plant of the
Brazils from being again confounded with the Ipecacuanha plant of New
Spain, by contrasting their descriptions, I shall annex Brotero's description
of the former plant, as contained in the 6th volume of the Linnæan Trans
actions, and a description of the latter formed from that of Mutis, as given
by Linnæus in Supplem. Plant, p. 144.; and from one lately published by
Humboldt and Bonpland in Plantes Equinoxiales. Livraison 16. p. 142.

  Page 24. — Shark's Eye.


The eye of the shark which I have mentioned in the text, was detached
from the socket before it came into my possession, and did not enable me
to obtain any very precise information respecting its very beautiful and
complicated apparatus. Since sending that part of my work to the press, I
have been presented with a preparation of a shark's eye, with most of its
appendages, in spirit, by Mr. Radkin, the assistant surgeon of the Lyra,
who never lost the opportunities afforded him by his commander of
examining the structure of any singular or interesting animal taken on board the
Lyra. He accompanied the preparation with the following notice of the
organization of the shark's eye, and his permission to publish it in this
Appendix. The Squalus Carcharias was the subject of Mr. Radkin's
examination; and the following is his account of the structure of its visual
organ : — " On dividing the skin around the eye, I found a great quantity
of watery fat lining the socket, on removing which I obtained a A'iew of
the muscles of the eye. The most external, which from its use might
be called Levator Squammœ Oculi, arises from the upper and back part
of the skull near its junction with the vertebræ, takes a course
downAvards and forwards, passes over a small groove in the end of a jugular
proces.s, is retained in the groove by a ligament, and is inserted tendinous into
a cartilaginous covering for the eye. Its use is to pull up this covering,
situated as a lower eyelid.

\"The next muscles which appear are the anterior and posterior oblique,
which require no particular description.


\"The remaining muscles are four recti, which arise from and envelope a
cartilaginous fulcrum, first to be described. A cylindrical, dense, cartilaginous
body, about two inches long, and of the diameter of a crow's quill, arises
from the bottom of the socket and passes straight to the centre of the ball.
Its extremities, Avhich are rounded, articulate with the socket and the
sclerotica by cartilaginous cup-like cavities, and are confined to them by
capsular ligaments. The reeti muscles arise tendinous from the fulcrum
close to its articulation with tlie orbit; from thence they diverge on all sides
the fulcrum, and are inserted by broad tendinous expansions into the
sclerotica.


\"The optic nerve passes through the orbit full the fourth of an inch from
the origin of the fulcrum, but converging unites Avith it on entering the
sclerotica."


Such is Mr. Radkin's description of the structure of the eye of a shark
recently dead.


On examining the eye, preserved in spirit, I find that its covering
externally is of a fine scaly texture, resembling in all respects, excepting
in the minuteness of the scales, the skin of the animal; interiorly it is lined
with a delicate membrane, as fine and soft as that which lines the eyelids
of any other animal. This organisation would seem to belong rather to an
eyelid than a nictating membrane..


The straight muscles consist of two lateral, and one superior, and one
inferior. They arise very distinctly from the cartilaginous stem; the
superior and inferior at more than the fourth of an inch above its articulation
with the socket. Each of the lateral, although also arising from it, send
down, epecially the posterior one, a prolongation of tendon for insertion
into the orbit. In the sclerotica they are inserted at equal distances around the
o-lobe of the eye, behind the transparent cornea. This disposition of the
straight muscles of the shark's eye obviously prevents the cartilaginous body
assisting their action as a lever so much as has been supposed.


The oblique muscles arise near each other in the anterior part of the orbit,
the superior passing obliquely downAvards, and the inferior obliquely upwards.
Their office is. to rotate the eye on its axis. In ordinary action, they
probably affect only the articulation of the cartilaginous stem with the globe of
the eye; but where the greatest extent of motion is requisite,they may  
  
  
  * x x 2
<!-- Leaf 402, Page: 340 -->
also affect its articulation with the socket. The cartilaginous stem, indeed,
seems intended rather to give extent than power to the action of the
muscles.


The optic nerve is admirably defended, by its position, from all pressure.
It enters the orbit at the distance of more than the fourth of an inch
from the cartilaginous stem, and passes into the globe of the eye in the
angle formed between the inferior and anterior straight muscles: the action
of these being in different directions, widens the angle through which it
passes. At its communication with the orbit it is united to the stem by
cellular substances.


The annexed plate is taken from Mr. Radkin's preparation. The parts
are shrunk by the action of the spirit, but their relative position is well
shown.

This plant has received various appellations in the different countries
where it grows. The Chinese call it the pig-basket plant, from the
resemblance of its appendage to the wicker machine in which they carry pigs
to market. According to Rumphius, it is sometimes called by the Malays
the '■' pitcher plant," because its appendages resemble the vessels in which
they collect water; and sometimes the " devil's pitchers," because they
are found in uncultivated places supposed to be inhabited by fauns, or evil
spirits of woods and mountains.

To the same author avc owe an account of several superstitions held by
the Malays respecting it. He states that the natives of Amboyna were
unwilling to bring him specimens of the plant from the mountains, from the full
persuasion that if the appendages were gathered and emptied of the water,
heavy rain Avould overtake them before their return. In conformity Avith
<!-- Leaf 403, Page: 341 -->
the same belief, when suffering from a long drought they pour the water
from all the appendages they can find, satisfied that the ceremony will be
followed by a change of weather. Such belief is curiously contrasted with
their notions of the medicinal properties of the water contained in them,
Avhich they believe an infallible specific for incontinence of urine. " Quum
pueri in cubilibus mejant, turn incola montes ascendit, ibique petit quasdam
plenas nee apertas cantharas, quarum aquæ certain portionem puerorum

loc. cit.  
  
  
  Page 50.—Great Snake of Java.


I have called this animal, of which I am now to attempt a further
description, the great snake of Java, merely in reference to the locality of
the individual specimen whose habits I have described in the text. There
can be little doubt, I apprehend, that he might with equal propriety be
designated-the great snake of the Indian isles, the Ular saxva, or water-snake,
of the Malays, the Python amethiste of Daudin, and Pytho Javanicus of
Cuvier. The arrangement of the scales of the under part of the tail,
accurately represented in the drawing, would seem decidedly to separate it
from the Boa on the one hand and the Coluber on the other, and give it
unequivocally to Daudin's genus of Pytho, which he has thus described in
the Magasin Encyclopedique, torn. v. Annee viii. " Des plaques entieres
sous le corps et la queue, celle-ci muni aussi quelquefois de doubles plaques.
Anus horde d'ecailles et muni de deux eperons ou ergots, par des crochets
venimeux." But I fear the disposition of the scales under the tail will be
found a very variable character; and that in some species, not otherwise
distinguishable from the snake I am describing, the single plates will be found
entirely wanting. In two specimens from the East Indies which I have lately
seen at Exeter Change, agreeing with the snake that I have described in every
other character, no single plates existed near the anus, and only three were
to be found mingled with the double row which otherwise occupied the whole
extent of the under part of the tail. Still, however, if any number of single
scales constantly occur, they will keep the animal within the genus Pytho, as
defined by Daudin, to which, in the present imperfect arrangement of
serpents, it Avill be safest to refer it. It is obviously much more nearly allied to
<!-- Leaf 404, Page: 342 -->
the genus Coluber than that of Boa, as the variation in the arrangement
of the plates, in the instances that I have mentioned, brought the individuals
close to the former and removed them more widely from the latter.
Whether the anatomy of other serpents answering to the genus Pytho
separate them from the genus Coluber I know not; but I have been indebted
to Sir Everard Home, who has examined one of the vertebræ of the Java
snake, for the observation, that it differs from a vertebra of the Boa
in Avanting the process to which the constrictor muscles of the latter
animal are attached, and which is shoAvn in the figure of one of the vertebræ
of a Boa Constrictor, in his Lectures on Comparative Anatomy. It will
be found, however, from the specific description, to approach the Boa in the
small scales on the back of the head, and in having its lips jagged.


As I am not aware that any particular set of characters are yet considered
by naturalists as sufficient in themselves to form a specific description of
serpents, I shall trust to a full detail of those which appear to me most
likely to lead to identify it with others of its species.

Species.


Form—The shape may be compared to a double cone, tapering towards
the head and tail, the greatest diameter of the body being its middle. The
diminution of size is gradual to the anus; beyond it is rapid to the end of
the tail. It is gradual to the end of the neck; beyond, the swelling of
the head interrupts the gradation. The head is larger at its base than the
neck. In shape it resembles a truncated cone, having its base at its union
with the neck.


Colour — Greenish brown, with a purplish tinge, and yellow and black.
Two brownish yellow bands arise from a point between the nostrils, near
the margin of the upper lip, and diverging pass between the eyes, reach the
back part of the head, where they divide each into two bands; the outer
band on each side, after sending off" a smaller one round the angle of the jaw,
becomes of a lighter colour, and loses itself in the general yellow colour
of the belly. The two inner bands traverse the whole extent of the
back, communicating with each other by transverse bands, and sending out
<!-- Leaf 405, Page: 343 -->
on each side lateral branches which communicate together, and forming over
the whole back a reticulated or chain-like appearance. The interstices thus
formed are of different colours in different parts. On the back they are of
a brownish green in the centre, and black in the margin. Their central
colour becomes lighter as they approach the belly. The reticulations are
also lighter near the belly, and have often an edging of brilliant yellow.
The colour of the belly is bright yellow, passing into green on the sides,
and is variegated with black spots. Black spots form two regular rows, one
on each side, from the throat down to the anus; and are situated on the second
row of scales, counting from the great plates on the centre of the belly.
The head is strikingly marked. A narrow streak of yellow, edged by black,
is situated on the back part of the head, between the divergence of the
principal bands. A narrow yellow band passes directly downwards from
the eye to the mouth, and forms an angle with another which passes
from the posterior corner of the eye to the angle of the jaw.


Scales — Flat; on the back and throat disseminated; on the belly
imbricated. The scales of the back are oval and flat, and do not overlay each
other till they approach the belly. On the hind part of the head they
are smaller than in other parts of the body; over the nose they are
broader and of irregular forms, resembling in their disposition the
articulations of the flat bones of the head; on the margin of the upper lip they
are broad and oblong, casing thc lip in a regular order. The scales of the
under part of the body are variously disposed. From the margin of the lower
lip to some distance beyond the angle of the lower jaw they are loosely
disseminated, and under the mouth are divided by a narrow expansible membrane.
They arise from scales edging the lower lip, and having their ends free, give
a jagged appearance to the mouth. The scales of the throat increase in size
till they terminate in the great plates passing along the belly to the anus.
These are broad, oblong, flat, rounded on the angles of their free edges,
and are arranged in a single imbricated row. Laterally they imbricate with
a row of very broad scales following their whole extent; these in like
manner imbricate with a second row of broad scales, which gradually pass
into those of the back: it might perhaps be said that three rows of
plates occupy the whole extent of the belly, but the lateral rows differ
from the central in being oval on their free edges.  
  
  
  The scales of the tail are arranged in the following order :

Five pair of broad plates, similar to those of the belly.  
  
  
  Forty-three pair of smaller plates.
<!-- Leaf 406, Page: 344 -->
  
  Seven single plates.  
  
  
  Five pair of small plates.


Three single plates.

The tip of the tail is covered with very small scales closely imbricated.
The anal orifice is guarded on the sides by very small scales intimately
clasping each other. Towards the belly the central broad plate somewhat
overlays the orifice; toward the tail a broad scale on each side closes it by the
meeting of their internal edges, which are free. The angle formed between
their convex ends is filled up by a small oval plate.


Claws—strong curved; one on each side the anus. These claws spring
from prominent cartilaginous cushions.


Observation.—I have examined the claws of some other species of snake
exhibiting about town, from the East Indies, and have ahvays found them
straight. The drawing which is given in the text having been taken from
the skin of the animal after it had been for some time preserved in spirit,
the membranous parts appear relaxed, and the anal orifice open.  
  
  
  Pages 67, 68. — Temperature of the Sea.


The general conclusion to be inferred from the experiments stated in the
text is the same which is deducible from the greater number of those made
by other observers. And although these experiments have not been so
numerous as the importance of the subject merits, they have been made by
Forster and Irving, in the highest southern and northern latitudes, reached in
the voyages of Cook and of Phipps; and by Peron and others, at the equator
and intermediate seas. These experiments, as far as they regard the
temperate and torrid zones, have uniformly shown that the " temperature of the
sea diminishes in proportion to its depth." But this deduction does not
invariably follow, from the experiments of Forster and Irving in high
latitudes; especially when the temperature of the water at the surface closely
approaches the freezing point.  
  
  
  
The two experiments of Forster to which I allude * are the following : On
the 15th of December, 1772, being in latitude 55° south, this observer sent
down an apparatus, for ascertaining the temperature of the sea, to the depth
of 100 fathoms, Fahrenheit's thermometer in the air standing at 30|°, the  
  
  
  * Forster's Observations.
<!-- Leaf 407, Page: 345 -->
temperature of the surface being 30°. The instrument having remained at the
given depth seventeen minutes, and having been drawn up in five minutes and
a half, the inclosed thermometer marked 34°; the temperature of the sea
at the depth of 100 fathoms being four degrees higher than at the surface.
On December the 23d he repeated the experiment at the same depth,
the temperature of the air being 33 \ of the surface 32% the instrument
having remained down sixteen minutes and been withdrawn in six and a
half, gave a temperature of 34 V' '■> m this instance the temperature of the
sea at the given depth was 2.'T° higher than at the surface. The experiment
of Irving* is no less at variance with the result of experiments made when
the surface has been of a comparatively high temperature; and his
experiment is the more interesting, as his instrument descended below the ice.
On August the 4th, 1773, when in 80° 30' N. lat., he sent down an
apparatus to the depth of sixty fathoms, the temperature of the air being 32?,
of the surface 36\ and the instrument being drawn up the inclosed
thermometer stood at 39°, the temperature at the given depth being 3° higher
than that of the surface.


These facts show the necessity of further experiments before we can
frame a due expression of the law regarding the temperature of the sea
at different depths. Observations in various latitudes and various depths
must be greatly multiplied before it will admit of precise definition. In
the present state of information on the subject it may perhaps be legitimate
to conclude, that the temperature of the sea in all latitudes diminishes in
proportion to its depth Avithin some limit, when the temperature of its surface
is much above the freezing point.


I may venture in this place to remark, that the greater temperature of the
sea near the poles, at considerable depths, than at the surface, favours the
opinion of the bottom of the ocean being constantly at a uniform
temperature. What this temperature may be we do not possess sufficient data to
determine; but it is not perhaps unreasonable to conjecture (leaving the
theory of a central fire out of consideration) that it is at that point where the
water has the greatest density, a point known to be above that of freezing.


The zealous naturalist of the French expedition to Terra Australis, in
endeavouring to establish his favourite propositions, that the temperature  
  
  
  * Phipps's Voyage.  
  
  
  Y Y
<!-- Leaf 408, Page: 346 -->
of the sea in all latitudes diminishes in proportion to its depth, and has no
other limit than the eternal congelation of the bottom of the ocean, " la
congelation eternelle de ces abimes," has endeavoured to explain away the
consequences of Forster's experiments. " Si (he observes) I'on fait attention
que ces experiences ont ete fades au milieu de Vete de ces regions, c'est a dire
au mois Decembre, on concevra satis peine que les montagnes de glace qui
se resolvoient de toute part devoient entretenir ci la surface la basse
temperature observee par Forster; tandisqu' a des profondeurs plus considerables,
la fusion des glaces n'ay ant pas lieu, la chaleur que les rayons du soleil
pouvoient y faire descendre devoit s'y maintenir momentanement plus grande."
This explanation appears scarcely admissible, because, in the next
experiment stated in Forster's table, and made in a much higher latitude, and
equally or more amidst the ice, no such comparative cooling occurred; for in
this experiment, in lat. 64°, the surface was 33{°, and at the given depth 32°;
and because in the first of the tAvo experiments to which he alludes, the air
was two degrees below the freezing point, and would not therefore admit the
melting of the ice. Still less would this explanation do away the objectionable
result of Irving's experiment made in 80° north, from which it appears that
below the ice the temperature was found to be at 39°, or 7° above the freezing
point, that of the surface being 36\ With equal inconsistency of argument
and candour of statement, the author, in reasoning upon Irving's experiments
has overlooked this result entirely, and drawn from them the same conclusion
that he had before done from others, that the temperature is constamment
plus foible au fond qu' d la surface de la mer; but has in perfect fairness
given, in his valuable table of experiments by different observers, as well
the facts which oppose, as favour his opinions. *


With regard to the hypothesis of the same author, that the bottom of the
ocean is a body of ice, the following objection of Professor Horner, the
astronomer to Krusenstern's expedition, seems almost unanswerable : " The
saltness of the sea is inconsistent with the idea of ground ice. As water
cannot freeze while any foreign matter is mixed with it, the fresh water must
first separate from its saline contents: but at the instant of its separation,
before it becomes ice, it must ascend by its greater specific lightness
into higher and warmer strata; so that ice can never form in the depth of
the sea."

<!-- Leaf 409, Page: 347 -->

I cannot dismiss this subject without noticing a magnificent experiment
of Captain Wauchope's, of His Majesty's ship Eurydice, and which I hope
will be given more circumstantially to the public by that gentleman, together
with others which have a peculiar value from the caution of the observer,
the completeness of his apparatus, and the unparalleled depth to which it
descended. When within a few degrees of the equator, during a calm, this
gentleman put his apparatus overboard, and allowed it to descend till it
had carried out 1400 fathoms of line; but estimated the perpendicular
depth at 1000 fathoms. The temperature of the surface was at 73° of
Fahrenheit. On drawing up the instrument, he found the inclosed
thermometer marking 42°; a difference of temperature between the surface
and given depth of 31°.

  Page 58. — Tidings of the Embassy favourably received by the Chinese
Government.


Since sending the first part of this work to the press I have been indebted
to Mr. Morrison's Journal for the folloAving account of the ceremony of
delivering the Earl of Buckinghamshire's letter, which announced the coming
of the Embassy to the local government of Canton.


\"The British government, in conjunction with the Hon. the Court of
Directors of the East India Company, deeming it expedient to send an Embassy
to China, Earl Buckinghamshire, President of the Board of Controul, wrote to
the Viceroy of Canton, to announce the intention of His Royal Highness
the Prince Regent.


\"His Lordship's letter arrived in the close of May 1816. Sir George
Staunton, President of the Select Committee, wrote from Macao to inform the
local government, and to request a proper conveyance to Canton in order
to present the letter.


\"Sir Theophilus Metcalfe, a member of the Committee, Capt. Clavell of
{empty}H. M. ship Orlando, Mr. Morrison, who then acted as Translator and
Secretary for the Chinese department to the Select Committee, and Mr. Daniel],
a member of the Company's establishment in China, proceeded to Canton,
and requested an audience of the Fooyuen *, (the Viceroy then being at
Court,) which was accordingly fixed to be on the 4th of June, the day after
our arrival in Canton.


\"We proceeded in chairs to the office of the Fooyuen, at the gate of Avhich
we alighted, and were led on the left side of the great hall into an
apartment, in which the principal Hong merchants were waiting to receive us,
and give us tea. We had sat about ten minutes, during which time it was
negotiated, whether Sir Theophilus should give the letter into the Fooyuen's
hand, or pass it through another person. Sir Theophilus insisted on the
first, which was granted. At a signal given, the doors of the ball were
thrown open, a shout raised by the attendants, and a salute of three guns fired.
The Tartar general, called Tseang-Keunyous, was present on the occasion,
with a detachment of troops, forming a path up to the hall. The imperial
Commissioner for foreign trade, called the Hoo-poo, (or Hoppo,) was also  
  
  
  * Fooyuen is the second officer in a province: he acts for the Viceroy in his absence.
<!-- Leaf 412, Page: 350 -->
there. Our party was then requested to proceed with the letter, which,
contained in a box, was carried in form by Mr. Morrison. We walked up to the
higher end of the hall, made a bow, and put on our hats again, as it was
inconvenient to stand with them in the hand. After which, Sir Theophilus
Metcalfe opened the box and gave the letter into the Fooyuen's hand. He
received it, rose and asked if our aged king was well, and how the Prince
Regent did, spoke of the former embassy with satisfaction, and then gave
the letter into the hands of an attendant officer. On this we AA-ithdrew,
returned to the door of the room we had left, and prepared to leave the
the palace. Puankhequa, an old and active Hong merchant, who managed
the announcing of the last embassy, desired us to wait till some questions
should be put by the Fooyuen.


\"Sir Theophilus, however, thought that these had better be sent to the
Factory, as more respectful on the part of the Chinese, and also as affording
more time to give suitable answers. Old Puankhequa pressed our stay in
vain, then sighing said, " Mei-yeu-fa" — " There is no help for it."


\"Sir Theophilus remained at Canton several days, during which time various
questions were brought from the government, as, What number of ships
were coming? What the Ambassador's name was? What the presents
were ? Whether the ships would come to Macao or not ? What nations of
Europe had been at war ? What age the Prince Regent was ? When the
reins of government were given to him ? &c. &c.


\"In a day or two the government sent out to require that Capt. Clavell
whom Puankhequa had untruly represented as the bearer of Earl
Buckinghamshire's letter, should remain till an answer was received from court. A
document was found on record, proving that the Hong merchants had, when
Lord Macartney's embassy was announced, given a bond to government,
promising that the gentleman who brought the dispatches there would remain
for a reply from court. Capt. Clavell would make no such promise, as the
letter, in fact, was not brought by him, and he purposed to leave before an
answer could arrive. Sir Theophilus gave a written paper, saying that he
would remain; but the government would not be satisfied with it, but
required the Hong merchants to promise in behalf of Capt. Clavell. The Hong
merchants declined. They were taken to the Kwang-chow Foo's office, and
detained a day or two; when finally, they came to an understanding, by
giving the bond required, and obtaining an assurance from the government
that the promise given in the bond, should not be exacted of them.


\"This affair being arranged, Sir T. Metcalfe and the gentlemen who
accompanied him returned to Macao."
<!-- Leaf 413, Page: 351 -->

\"Europeans and Chinese had various opinions respecting the reception of
the Embassy. Some of the first, Avho had means of knowing a little of the
temper of the court, affirmed that the embassy would not be allowed to land;
and Chinese of respectable standing in society, were persuaded that it
would certainly not be received by the way of Teen-tsin, but would be
required to go by the way of Canton; and if it did go so far as Teen-tsin, it
would have to return and land at Canton."  
  
  
  Page 69.—Visit of Mr. Morrison to the Legate, on his Arrival at Ta-koo.


The following account by Mr. Morrison, of his reception by the Legate,
being an illustration of national manners, and of the light in which the
Chinese ministers held some of the officers of the Embassy, I have thought
its insertion in this place would be acceptable to my readers : —


\"The passage into the Pei-ho is exceedingly shallow; in some places not
more than two feet. Ta-koo, a poor village, is situated a mile or two from
the entrance. In a temple at this place, the Legate had taken up his abode.
It rained when we reached the beach, and we had to wait till we were
announced. The officer with us was civil, in endeavouring to keep us from
the rain. In a short time carriages, or covered single-horse carts, were
brought to the beach; we got into them, and drove off, about a quarter of a
mile, through a very dirty road, to the temple; all around was a flat, marshy,
unproductive, gloomy region. We entered an inner room in the temple, and
were required to send in our names, and what we were, to the still inner
apartment where the Legate was. On being ushered in, we stepped over
the threshold, walked up, and made our bow.


\"On looking round there were no chairs to receive us, but
withoutside the threshold were placed three chairs. We went to conciliate, and
therefore, though we felt the haughty reception intended, took no notice of
it, but sat down.*


• " In Chinese apartments, there is placed at the head of the room, a large broad couch, called
a kang. In the middle of it stands a table, about eighteen inches high, intended to rest the arm
on, or to place tea on. On each side of this two persons sit. The left is the place of honour.
From the ends of the couch, at right angles, are placed two rows of chairs; the rank diminishes as
they recede from the couch. The first in the left side-row is the highest place. To prevent
persons taking a place they do not wish them, they sometimes remove the chairs, as was the
case in the present instance. There were no chairs at the head of the right-hand row, but three
placed, as I have already observed, without-side the threshold."
<!-- Leaf 414, Page: 352 -->

« The Legate sat on the right-hand end of the couch, leaving the chief
place empty for his absent colleague. At the upper end of the left row of
chairs, the commander of the district, with a red button in his cap, sat.
Next to him, Yin, a military officer (Hee-tue), with a red button, and
Chang, a civil officer (Tuon-tue), of Teen-tsin, with a blue button. These
two persons were to attend upon the accommodation and safe conduct of the
Embassy, under the Legate and Viceroy. These two gentlemen properly
bore the title of Ta-laou-yay, ' Great venerable Father;' but in their
intercourse with foreigners were called by their domestics Ta-jin, ' Great Men.'
The Legate and Yin were Tartars; Chang was a Chinese; Kwang, the
Legate, was a little man, about fifty-eight years of age, pleasant and
conversible in his manner, but artful and fraudulent; seeking to obtain his purpose
rather by negative than positive acts; withdrawing the means of comfort,
rather than by inflicting Avhat was disagreeable; close-minded, specious,
and clever. Yin was of low stature and ruddy complexion, and good
natured, with a little of the feudal pride of the Tartar, and ignorant as
Tartar Chinese military men generally are. Chang was rather old, tall, thin,
and emaciated, it is to be apprehended, by the use of opium and debauchery.
The commander of the troops at Ta-koo, was not seen frequently enough
to form an opinion of his character.


\"In the presence of this assembly, the Legate began in a distinct and
cheerful tone, to inquire the distance we had come; whether we had touched
at Macao ? how long we had come from thence ? whether we had met the
vessels he had sent to meet us? (he had never sent any;) the number of
ships ? of men in the ships ? of persons in the Embassy ? and so on; to
which he received such answers as truth and prudence suggested. The
other gentlemen joined the Legate in expressing their satisfaction.


\"He hinted, that instead of seventy-five persons, fifty would be enough;
to which it was replied, that to China, twenty or thirty, more or less, could
be of very little consequence; that to do the thing liberally would be
handsome. He received the suggestion, and we heard no more of the objection
till it was too late to alter it. He said that Chang and Yin would the next
day go on board our ships to wait on the Ambassador and the Commissioners.


\"After this we withdrew, and had a dinner in the Chinese manner with
the inferior officers who had been on board. In the temple there Avas an
upper story, from which we had a view of the surrounding country, and of
the ships in the roads. Their masts only Avere visible. An officer entered
<!-- Leaf 415, Page: 353 -->
into conversation with Mr. Morrison, and informed him, that he understood
the Embassy would not remain at Court so long as the last one did : that His
Imperial Majesty was going to Je-ho, in Tartary, and did not mean to take
the Embassy thither. We heard that the Viceroy, Na-yen-ching, who had been
ordered to attend to the Embassy, was since disgraced, and cast into prison.


\"We went into one of the priest's rooms to take tea, and found hanging
against the wall, as idol pictures do, an European print of the head of Jesus
Christ, crowned with thorns, and a reed in his hand. Around, on the
Chinese paper, in the centre of which it was pasted, were Chinese characters.
When requested to take it down the priest declined, saying that it was
dedicated, and he could not take it down; but he showed to Mr. Morrison a
service, in mysterious Chinese phraseology, which was read when the picture
Avas worshipped. We remained at the Temple all night, lodged upon benches
covered with mats, without any bedding whatever; not even a pillow for
our heads. Lieutenant Cooke and Captain Crawfurd being inured to bear
fatigue, did not regard it: Mr. Morrison, from the want of rest, and a
rough passage back to the ships next morning, was much indisposed for two
or three days. The Legate intended to have given us some presents in the
morning, but our rough lodging induced us to hasten our departure very
early. The Chinese afterwards made an apology for treating us so ill."  
  
  
  Page 69. — Cards of Compliment receivedfrom Chang and Yin.


These cards of red paper, in several folds, were about eighteen inches in
length when folded. " In the middle of the page," Mr. Morrison has
observed, " was written their names and rank, beginning with Teen-chaon,
' Of the celestial empire.' This style of card is commonly affected in their
intercourse with foreigners. Amongst themselves they write on much
smaller cards their name, prefacing it with Yu-te, ' your simple younger
brother,'or some other expression of humility, and closing it Avith sun-show-pae,
' boAvs his head, and Avorships.' "

Tri
bute-bearers; or more properly, according to Mr. Morrison, Kung-she, or

Envoys with Tribute.


In the document transmitted from the Ambassador, through Mr. Morrison,
to the Chinese government, the Ambassador and Commissioners were styled
Wang-chæ, " Royal Envoys," and the presents Le-wuh, " Things given from

courtesy." The Chinese wish to call foreign ambassadors Kung-she, " Envoys
with tribute," and the presents Kung-wuh, " Articles of tribute." That the
word kung has long been understood as here stated, appears by the following
quotation :— " Kœo-tsong, of the Lung dynasty, made peace with the Tartar
King Hi-tsong, on very dishonourable conditions; for on signing this treaty
he made use of the word chin, which signifies subject, and of cong, which is
tributary." — Du Haide. It may occur to the reader, that the Chinese give
presents in return; this is true, but they call them by a very different name,
viz. Shang, " a thing bestowed on an inferior." The letters which have
passed between European Sovereigns and Chinese Emperors have not been
called by the same name. The letters which they receive, they wish to be
called Pea-su-wan, " a representation made," as if by petition. The letters
they give are called Chih, " an imperial mandate." We used the word
Shoo, " a book, or letter," such as passes betAveen equals. The Chinese
allowed us our own phraseology, and in speaking to us generally Used it;
what they wrote on the flags of boats, or used amongst themselves, we could
not controul."  
  
  
  Page 76. — Trackers of the Boats of the Embassy.


The following observations, extracted from Mr. Morrison's journal,
respecting the trackers employed in China, have so much interest as to
require no apology to my reader for their insertion in this place : —

■ " The boats were dragged by human effort. Poor miserable looking men
passed cords across their breast, over one shoulder and under the other arm,
and walked forward in a leaning posture, pulling at the end of the rope,
which had its other end fastened to the mast-head of the vessel, to which they
were giving motion. There are sometimes ten, twenty, or thirty men
employed to drag one boat. These men thus engaged are called Tseen-foo.
Where there are not persons whose constant occupation is tracking, or where
an extraordinary number is required, government impresses poor people,
wherever they find them, for one day's journey; and to have them ready on
the arrival ofa fleet, sometimes confines them for a day or a night. At one
place we found a temple, dedicated to the Ming-keen-sheh-wang, « ten
judges in Hades,' converted into a prison, to confine the trackers over-night.
Four of our party went to see the temple, but found its gate chained up,
and the magistrate of the town's seal upon it. A military officer used his
influence to have it opened for us, but the large group of imprisoned trackers
<!-- Leaf 417, Page: 355 -->
had so manured the courts of the temple during the night, it was with great
difficulty we could find an uncovered spot to tread on, or bear the strong
effluvia which exhaled from the rich deposit.


The trackers have a song which they call tseen-foo-ko, which they chaunt
to inspirit them, and give unison to their efforts. The greater part of it is
merely the tone of exertion, interspersed with a few expressions, alluding to
the country they are passing, and the place to which they look as the end
of their toils. One person repeats the sentences, which have meaning, and
the whole join in a chorus, hei-o, Wo-to-hei-o, the import of Avhich appears
to be, ' pull away, let us pull away.' Mr. Morrison requested a man to
write down a tracker's song and it closed by holding out the hope of a
breakfast when they reached Teen-tsin."  
  
  
  Page 83. —Ceremony of Prostration.


The ceremony performed by the Chinese at Tien-sing, and required by
them of the British Ambassador, was the san-kwei-kew-kow, or the kotow,
nine times repeated. The following notice respecting the forms of respect
at present observed in China, is taken from Mr. Morrison's journal: —


\"The lowest form by which respect is shown in China, at this day, is
kung-show, that is, joining both hands, and raising them before the breast.
The next is tso-yeh, that is, bowing low with the hands joined. The third
is ta-tseen, bending the knee, as if about to kneel. The fourth is kwei,
to kneel. The fifth ko-tow, kneeling and striking the head against
the ground. The sixth sam-kow, striking the head three times against the
earth before rising from one's knees. The seventh lul-kow, that is, kneeling
and striking the forehead three times, rising on the feet, kneeling down
again, and striking the head again three times against the earth. The climax
is closed by the san-kwei-kew-kow, kneeling three different times, and at
each time knocking the head thrice against the ground.


\"Some of the gods of China are entitled only to the sam-kow, others to
the liil-kow; the Tien (Heaven) and the Emperor, are worshipped by the
san-kwei-kew-kow."  
  
  
  Page 95.—Visit of the Ambassador to the Imperial Commissioners, at Tung-chow.


The following interesting account of the interview of Lord Amherst with
the imperial commissioners, is from the pen of Mr. Morrison : —  
  
  
  " The party finally arrived at the Heo-yuen, or Literary Hall, of Tung  
  
  
  z z 2
<!-- Leaf 418, Page: 356 -->
Chow. There was no antichamber in which a person could sit down, and
the Ambassador had to stand a few minutes till our arrival was announced.
Four persons were invited into the room in which the Duke was. Its being
small was assigned as a reason for more not going in. Mr. Amherst bore his
father's train.


\"The Che-chou, or magistrate of the town, was in waiting. He was a
person who at first professed to be very civil, but Avho, from the trouble the
public service had given him, soon changed his tone and manner; and his
eyes, which at no times looked straight before him, for he squinted much,
indicated the utmost aversion. He said that szeko-jin, < four men,' were
to go in. Old Chang, who was also of the party, corrected him, and said
sye-wei, ' four gentlemen.'


\"A small court-yard, not defended from the rain, was to be crossed by
the aid of umbrellas. This was effected; and a bamboo hanging screen
being raised, discovered the Duke, Muh and Kwang, standing about three
or four feet from the door, with their faces towards it. The Ambassador
made an inclination of the head, which the Duke did not return in any way,
but began, in a loud stern tone, ' We are especially sent here by the great
Emperor, to see the ceremony properly performed.' Mr. Morrison said,
4 Let the Ambassador be seated, and then converse.' The Duke replied,
his lip quivering with anger, « We stand, let him stand.' This Avas
explained to the Ambassador, who said, ' Very Avell, Ave'll stand.' The Duke
Avas then desired to resume what he was about to say. He began: « Teen
avoo leang jih. To woo ush kwang, As in heaven there are not two suns, so
on earth there are not two sovereigns. The great Emperor is Teen Lize, the
son of Heaven; before him all Kings should bow down. You know it;'
(looking at Mr. Morrison, who had been seen reading Confucius, and which
had reached the Duke's ears). The ceremony insisted on was coeval with
Hae-kwo, (the commencement of the dynasty). Feeling this to be no great
length of time, he added : * It has existed from the highest antiquity, and
Kang-kae-puh-tih cannot be altered. Without the performance of this
ceremony the Ambassador and his tribute will be forthwith rejected and cast
out,' throwing his hand from him as he pronounced the last words.


\"The Ambassador, instead of yielding to the impulse of feelings such as this
speech was calculated to produce, took no notice of the Duke's
rhodomontade; but with self-command, and a firm tone, said, that he considered the
Emperor of China as one of the greatest Sovereigns in the world, and from
His Royal Highness the Prince Regent also considering him in the same
<!-- Leaf 419, Page: 357 -->
point of view, he had sent him to compliment His Imperial Majesty. The
ceremony which he proposed to perform was the same as performed by the
last British Ambassador, Lord Macartney, which was graciously received by
the late Emperor.


\"The Duke's face put on a smile at the first part of this speech, and he took
a purse from his side, and gave it to Mr. Amherst; but when he heard the
close, he replied with warmth, « The affairs of the last embassy were its own
affairs. Those of the present embassy alone are Avhat we will converse
about.' He turned to Chang, who was standing by, and said, ' Do you
lead them out, and explain fully what I have said, and the reasons of it.'
The Ambassador being informed of this, saw plainly that nothing was to be
done Avith the Duke then, and he would not submit to be referred to a
person of Chang's rank to discuss the subject. He therefore asked the Duke if
he might expect to see him again. The Duke supposed that the Ambassador
considered the meeting as partaking of the nature ofa visit, and said, ' This is
not a visit, it is an official meeting on national affairs.' He was told that the
Ambassador considered it as such. He then said, ' Whether you see me
again or not, depends on the resolution you choose to come to.' On
hearing this, the Ambassador took the memorial from his pocket, and presented
it to the Duke, saying, ' I'll trouble you to transmit that to His Imperial
Majesty.'


\"The Duke, evidently disconcerted at such an unexpected occurrence, took
it, looked at the address, turned it over, passed it to Muh, and said, * it
is sealed.' The Duke was taken down a peg or two by this reference to his
master, and Avalked forward a few steps to see the Ambassador out. The
whole party immediately returned to the Ambassador's house."

  Page 147.—Notices respecting Mahomedans and Jews,  
  
  
  [from mr. Morrison's journal.]


\"Mahomedans were found in every part of our journey. They
frequently hold situations in the government.


\"On the evening of September 10th, whilst walking on shore at a village
called Too-leaou, about fifty miles from Teen-tsin, I observed written on the
lantern of a poor huckster's shop, Hwung-hwing-loou-teen, « An old
Mahomedan shop.' On stopping to ask the owner, Avho was an old man, whence
he came, he replied, ' from Seyang,' * the Western Ocean.' When urged
to say from what country of the West, he said he did not know. He
understood his family had been in the place he now was for five generations.


\"He informed me there were many Mahomedans in the neighbourhood;
they had a Le-pae-sze, ' Temple for Worship.' They observed every third
and seventh day; chiefly the seventh. They used for the Chinese word
Teen, * Heaven,' the word Choo, ' Lord or Sovereign.' The old man
could not read : he did not cease to sell commodities on the Sabbath.


\"October 13th. At a temple of Fuh, near Kwa-chow, I met with a
gentleman who held a situation under government. On entering into
conversation with him, it appeared that he was a Mahomedan.


\"He said, he understood that the Mahomedans came over to China
during the dynasty Tang, about twelve hundred years ago.


\"In Chinese the Mahomedans express the deity by Choo, « Lord,' and not
by Shin, ' a God, or Spirit;' because he said the Gods (Shin) were
included in things created. ' We,' said he, ' venerate the Lord, who is the
true Lord of what exists, and what does not; the Creator of all things,
He is not like any thing; not to be compared to any thing; the one only
true Lord.' He called the Sabbath by the name ' Choo-ma-ush.'


\"He informed me that at Kae-fung-fbo, in Honan province, there were
a few families denoted Teaou-kin-keaou, ' the plucking sinew sect,' because
they take the sinews from all the flesh which they eat. They also had a
Lepae-sye, or Temple of Worship. They observed the eighth day as a Sabbath.
He regarded them the same as the Teen-choo-keau, which is the name
by which the Christians are known in China.


\"The above statement exactly corresponds with what is related in Grosier,
on the authority of a Romish missionary. That person saAv and conversed
with the people of whom he spake, and he considered them as Jews.
<!-- Leaf 421, Page: 359 -->

\"The gentleman felt a little unwilling to converse on the subject of
religion; said it was not their custom to do it; but to satisfy the curiosity of
a stranger, and as I had been civil to his brother, he now did so. The priest
of Buddah was sitting by and handing tea all the time."


In addition to the notices contained in the above quotation respecting the
Mahomedans and Jews, I may add the following from different authorities.


According to the author of the essay entitled, " Idee Generate de la
Chine," contained in the fifth volume of the " Memoires concernant les
Chinois," Mahometanism was introduced into China by the Tartars. " Cette
religion s'introduisit a la Chine par les Tartares qui en faisoient profession.
La premiere epoque de son etablissement est done sous le regne de
Genghiskan; et celle de sa destruction, lorsque la dynastie Chinoise des Ming
remonta sur le trone et chassa les Tartares occidentaux de cet empire."
The author in this passage appears to mean the destruction of
Mahometanism as an established religion, for he immediately adds, " Les
Mahometans sont toleres a la Chine, parce qu'ils sont fort tranquilles, qu'ils ne
disputent point, et qu'ils ne se donnent aucun mouvement pour repandre
leur doctrine. On n'en compte que 5 a 6000 families, gens de basse
condition, et auxquels on fait tres-peu d'attention." This last statement, as far
as it regards their numbers and poverty, is in some degree contradicted by
a letter from a missionary, written at Pekin in the year 1721, although it
states that they were then held in great contempt by the Chinese. " La secte
des Mahometans s'etend de plus en plus; ils se soutiennent principalement
par le grand commerce qu'ils font dans les provinces, et par les sommes
d'argent qu'ils donnent liberalement aux Mandarins, car ils sont fort, riches.
Mais du reste les Chinois ont pour eux le plus grand mepris." Lettres
Edifiantes et Curieuses, torn. xix. p. 140.


Du Haide remarks, " Au dela du Hoang-ho, on trouve sur le Canal
quelques villes, que les Mahometans ont tache de rendre marchandes, en y
attirant le commerce; mais ils n'y ont pas reussi. Leurs mosquees sont fort
elevees, et la structure n'est nullement du gout Chinois. Apres une si longue
suite de generations, ils ne laissent pas d'etre regardez comme des gens,
dont l'origine est etrangere; et de terns en terns on leur fait des insultes."
Du Haide, folio, torn. i. p. 133.


Grosier has the following passage : " The Mahometans have multiplied
much more in China than the Jews. It is above six hundred years since
they first entered this empire, in which they have formed different
<!-- Leaf 422, Page: 360 -->
establishments. For a great number of years they were preserved only by
marriages, and by the alliances which they contracted; but for some
time past, they seem to have been more particularly attentive to the
care of extending their sect, and propagating their doctrine. The
principal means which they employ for this purpose are, to purchase for a
sum of money a great number of children brought up in idolatry, Avhom
their poor parents, compelled by necessity, readily part with. These they
circumcise, and afterwards educate and instruct in the principles of their
religion. During the time of a terrible famine which desolated the province
of Chang-tong, they purchased more than ten thousand of these children, for
Avhom when grown up they procured wives, and built houses, and they even
formed whole villages of them. They insensibly increased, and are now
become so numerous, that they entirely exclude from those places in which
they reside, every inhabitant who does not believe in their prophet, and
frequent a mosque. Grosier's Description of China, Transl. 8vo. vol. ii.
{empty}p. 270, 271.


Grosier's account of the Jews alluded to by Mr. Morrison, is entirely taken
from a letter written from Caisong-fou, the capital of Honan, by Father
Gozani, a Portuguese missionary, in November 1704. * This letter, and
information derived from other missionaries who had conversed with Jews
in China or visited them, have afforded materials for an interesting memoir
on the Jews in China, published in the 18th volume of the Lettres Edifiantes.
From all the authentic evidence adduced, it appears that a Jewish colony
first appeared in China in the reign of Hang-ming-ti, of the dynasty Han,
which began about the year 206 A.C. t, and that they came from Si-yu or
the western country. This country is supposed by the author of the memoir
to be Persia, as the Jews of Cai-song-fou have still many Persian words in
their language. They are called by the Chinese Hoai-hoai, an appellation
common to them and the Mahometans; but call themselves Tiao-kin-kiao,
\"the law of those who pluck out the sineAvs," because they have a law Avhich
prohibits their eating them, in memory of the combat of Jacob and the
angel. X During prayer in the synagogue they wear a kind of blue cap,
whence they derive the name of ian-maho-hoai-hoai, to distinguish them


* A translation of this letter from the Portuguese, is published in the eighteenth volume of the
Lettres Edifiantes.  
  
  
  f See Grosier, vol. ii. p. 259. X See Genesis, chapter xxxii.
<!-- Leaf 423, Page: 361 -->
from the Mahomedans Avho wear a white cap, and are, therefore, sometimes
called Pe-maho-hoai-hoai. In the early ages of their establishment in
China, the Jews possessed employments under the government and great
estates, and reckoned more than seventy families of the different tribes of
Benjamin, Levi, Juda, &c, but in later times a great part of them were
converted to Mahomedanism; and at the period when they were visited by
Father Gozani and other missionaries, they were reduced to seven families,
comprising about a thousand persons.


The misfortunes of the city of Cai-song-fou, which at all periods appears
to have contained a large proportion of their numbers, and their chief
synagogue, contributed greatly to lessen their amount. In the reign of
VanLee a conflagration reduced their synagogue to ashes, and destroyed all their
books except a Pentateuch. The synagogue having been rebuilt was again
destroyed in 1642 by the inundation of the Hoang-ho, or Yellow River :
re-established at the charge of Tchao, a Jewish mandarin, it was called
Lipai-se, " the place of ceremonies," a name which it still retains.


The Li-pai-se, according to Father Domanges, who passed eight
months at Cai-song-fou, is about sixty feet in length, and about forty in
breadth, but is surrounded by contingent buildings, occupying a space of
ground four hundred feet long, and a hundred and fifty wide. The buildings
inclose small courts ornamented with figures of lions, vases for incense,
flowers, and stone monuments bearing inscriptions setting forth the history
of the establishment. Immediately before the Li-pai-se, balustrades inclose
a space in which a great tent is pitched for the feast of the Tabernacles.


In the middle of the nave of the Li-pai-se, stands a magnificent chair raised
very high, and ornamented with a beautiful embroidered cushion. This is
the chair of Moses on Avhich is placed the Pentateuch on Saturdays and other
solemn days. Near the chair is a Van-sin-hai, or painting inscribed with
the Emperor's name. Over this is written in Hebrew letters of gold:
\"Hear, O Israel, Jehovah, our God, is the only God. Blessed be his Name;
Glory to His Kingdom for all eternity." In another part is a kind of square
tent, the " Holy of the Holies" of the Jews in China. They call it Bethel, in
the Chinese language Tien-tang, " Temple of Heaven." This place incloses
their Ta-kings or great books, as the copies of the Pentateuch are called. Over
the Bethel is written in Hebrew characters of gold : " Knotv that Jehovah
is the God of Gods, the Lord, a great God strong and terrible." Behind
the Bethel are the two tables of the law written in letters of gold. Near the  
  
  
  3 A
<!-- Leaf 424, Page: 362 -->
entrance of the Li-pai-se, is a hall containing a great number of censers, in
which the Chim-gris or great men of the law are worshipped. " The largest
of these censers, which is intended for the patriarch Abraham, stands in the
middle of the hall; after which come those of Isaac and of Jacob, and his twelve
branches or twelve tribes of Israel; next are those of Moses, Aaron, Joshua,
Esdras, and several other illustrious persons both male and female." Grosier.

Respecting their sacred books, the following quotation from the memoir
referred to, is the only notice which the limits of a note allow me to insert;
and I must refer my readers for further information to the interesting memoir
itself: " De tous ces monumens les Takings sont les plus interessans pour

les savans de l'Europe. Mais pour s'en former une juste idee, il faut savoir
que les Juifs Chinois ne donnent le nom de Taking ou de grande Ecriture,
qu'au seul Pentateuque. Ils en ont treize copies dans leur Bethel, posees sur
treize tables, en memoire des douze tribus et de Moise le fondateur de la Loi.
Ils sont ecrits non sur du parchemin, comme l'a dit le Pere Gozani, mais sur
du papier dont on a colle plusieurs feuilles ensemble pour pouvoir les rouler
sans craindre de les dechirer.


\"Chaque Taking du Bethel est roule sur un pivot, et forme une espece de
tente couverte d'un rideau de soie. Les Juifs ont pour tous ces livres la
plus grande veneration. II y en a cependant un qu'ils respectent plus que
tous les autres. Ils pretendent qu'il a trois mille ans d'antiquite, et que
c'est le seul monument qui leur reste. — Leurs autres livres ayant peri dans
les incendies ou dans les inondations, ils ont ete restitues sur les livres des

Since that part of this work went to the press, which mentions the
occurrence of large quantities of shells on the banks of the imperial canal, I
have been obliged to Dr. Leach for the information that he has formed a new
genus allied to Paludina, which he has called Bithynia, to which he refers the
shell mentioned in the text, which will be named Bithynia Sinensis, and will
be soon figured in Baron de Ferrussac's work sur les Coquilles Terrestres et
Fluviatiles. The type of the genus Bithynia, Dr. Leach remarks, is Helix
tentaculata of Linne, Cyclostona impurum of Drapernaud. It is distinguished
from Paludina not only by the characters presented by the shell, but also
by the form of the animal. The tentacula he describes as " elongato-teretr
subconica," and the operculum as testaceous.

The following passage from Louis Feuillee, respecting the properties of a
tall shrub, which he has described under the name of Capraria Peruviana,
the Xuaresia biflora of Ruiz and Pavon, Avould seem to render it certain that
the properties of tea are possessed by other plants.


\"Cet arbrisseau (Capraria Peruviana) ne fut connu dans le Perou qu'en
1709. Ses qualites, qui sont les memes que celles du The des Indes
Orientates, firent que les Peruvians abandonnerent bientot celui-ci pour ne se

An infusion of the leaves of the Atherosperma Moschata has been used as
tea. Mr. Brown, who accompanied Capt. Flinders to Terra Australis, has
permitted me to state, that whilst engaged in that country on his botanical
researches, he usually carried with him a supply of tea, as the means of the
most grateful refreshment. His attendants for a long time drank it with
delight, but unexpectedly relinquished it for the infusion of the leaves of
<!-- Leaf 427, Page: 365 -->
Atherosperma Moschata, which they found in the woods, and never recurred
to it when they could command the new-found substitute. Mr. Brown also
found that a slight infusion of the leaves of the Correa Alba so resembled tea,
as to deceive some of those who partook of it.

Camper states, in his anatomical treatise on the Orang-Outang of Borneo,
that in all the specimens of this animal which he examined, the great toes
Were without nails, and thinks the want of the nail characteristic of its species.
\"This Monkey or Orang, is possessed of the peculiar quality of having no nails
on the great toes. In my first Orang I did not immediately perceive this
peculiarity, but I presumed that the same would be the case with all the rest.


\"M. Van der Meulin, on my request, took his Orang out of the vessel in
which it was kept in spirits, and had the goodness to inform me on the
21st June 177L that it also had no nails on the great toes.


\"Before M. Allamand published his description, he did me the honour to
send me a proof impression of his Orang, in which I found the nails of the
great toes very plainly represented: this surprised me, since I also met in
Edwards' drawing the same large nails on the great toes. M.
Allamand being in the mean time apprised by me of this difference, examined
again his Orang, and corrected the fault of the engraver in his description,
page 75.


\"During this time I had also written to M. Rooistra, at that period a
renowned physician at the London Infirmary, and formerly one of my most
esteemed auditors, in order to examine with M. Maty of the British Museum,
whether the Orang represented by Edwards with such large nails, had
them in reality, on the great toes. On the 24th July 1772, I received
for answer, ' that there were no nails, even no remnants of them; much less
vestiges to be seen on the great toes of the Orang:' so little reliance can be
placed on engravings, if they be not executed by experienced and attentive
draftsmen, and under inspection of men acquainted with science.


\"The Orang presented by M. Hope, which I still preserve in spirits,
had likewise no nails on these parts, or that which was lent me by
{empty}M. Vosmær; neither were they on the great toes of the live Orang.
But there was a \evy small nail on the large toe of the right foot of the  
  
  
  * 3 a 3
<!-- Leaf 428, Page: 366 -->
Orang of M. Van Hoey, and two joints; while in the great toes of all
the others there was but one: this difference"appears rather to have been a
lusus naturæ; for the great toe of the left foot was, as in the former Orangs,
without a nail and with one joint. We may therefore conclude, that
this is something peculiar to this species. For although the Gibbon by
Landaard agrees in shape pretty well with the Orang, yet it has very large
and visible nails on the great toes, the same as may be seen in the large as
well as the small Gibbon of Buffon; but still plainer in the skeleton which
{empty}M. Van der Steeg had the goodness to send me not long ago from Batavia;
of which we are to speak more fully hereafter." Manuscript translation of
Camper's Treatise of the Orang-Outang of Borneo.


In addition to the facts adduced by Camper, I may state, that I have
been indebted to the kindness of Sir Joseph Banks, for the opportunity of
examining a manuscript notice respecting an Orang-Outang winch he saw at
Batavia, in the year 1770, in which the character " Pollex pedum sine ungue"
is distinctly stated. I have examined an Orang-Outang from Borneo,
preserved in spirits in the College of Surgeons, and found it without
nails on the great toes. The Orang-Outang described in the text, as I
have already stated, is also without them. Thus, including Camper's,
there are no less than nine indisputable instances in which Orang-Outangs
from Borneo or the neighbouring islands have been found without
nails on their great toes. So many concurring testimonies respecting the
existence of an important character in so many individuals of the same
species would seem to be decisive in favour of admitting it as a specific
distinction of the animal. The absence of the nail is a character of the
greater importance, from being, according to the experience of Camper,
always accompanied by the absence of one of the phalanges of the great
toes.


Camper, however, has been blamed by a great naturalist, for considering
the want of the nail a constant character in the Orang-Outang of Borneo:
\"II a eu tort de croire que les ongles manquent toujours a ses pouces de
derriere." * This opinion has, perhaps, been derived from the descriptions
given by M. Frederick Cuvier t and Tilesius-t of two Orang-Outangs

supposed to be brought from Borneo. I venture to use the qualification, "
supposed," in this place, although I have quoted these authors as describers of the
Orang-Outang of Borneo in the text; because, as it appears to me, there is a
deficiency of that direct evidence, both inF. Cuvier's and Tilesius's account,
which is necessary to fix the habitations of the animals which they describe.
The former received his specimen from the Isle of France by the hands of
{empty}M. Decaen, who stated that the animal had come there from * Borneo.
Tilesius saw the animal that he has described at Macao, in the possession of
the Portuguese governor, who believed that it had been brought from
Borneo, t It is one amongst many objections to this hearsay evidence, that in the
Eastern islands it is generally known that a species of Orang-Outang
inhabits Borneo, and that when Europeans in the East see any monkey
without a tail, they are liable to take for granted that it comes from that
island; and unless induced by scientific notions, are not likely to take much
pains in investigating the truth of their opinion. But till the accounts of
travellers respecting monkeys Avithout tails, remarkable for their resemblance to
man, and supposed to inhabit different parts of the East, as the XFese
of China and Golok § of Bengal, are disproved, it is necessary to be more
cautious in determining the dwelling places of similar animals that may fall
under our notice. Taking for granted that there was only one animal which

f Tilesius, after enumerating some curiosities shown him by the Governor of Macao,
and said to be brought from Borneo, states that he also saw a " Jocko, or East Indian
Orang-Outang, which was brought from the same island." Manuscript translation of

had been called Orang-Outang, led the great Buffon* to confound the Pongo
of Africa, (Simia Troglodytes of Linnæus,) described by Tulpius, Tyson,
Buffon, and others, with the Borneo Orang-Outang. A similar error might induce
naturalists of the present day to confound the true Borneo species with others
of its tribe. For these reasons I think it safer to conclude, that the descriptions
of F. Cuvier and Tilesius are deficient in satisfactory evidence of their animals
being natives of Borneo. But it may be said, if all the characters of these
animals accord with those of the Borneo species, excepting in the presence
of nails on the great toes, no other evidence of their identity is required. In
examining the description of F. Cuvier, with a view to this question, I find
an important difference between the relative length of the arms and height of
his animal, and the same dimensions of the one that I have described. The
greatest height of his animal, measured in the ordinary standing
posture, was thirty inches, and the length of his arm eighteen. " Debout, dans
sa position naturelle, sa taille n'excedoit pas 26 a 30 pouces; la longueur de
ses bras depuis l'aisselle jusqu'au bout des doigts etoit de hix-huit tpouces."
The greatest height of the animal that I have described, whether in his
standing posture or when stretched out on a table, is thirty-one inches and a half;
and his arm from the axilla to the end of the finger measures twenty-five inches.
In F. Cuvier's animal, therefore, the length of the arm compared with the
height of the body was as 18 to 30; in mine, it is 25 to 31-5; so that in the
smaller animal, the height of the body is greater in proportion to that of the
arm than in the larger. When the animal Avhich I have described is stretched
at full length, the ends of his fingers reach below the external ancle.
In a drawing of the animal described by F. Cuvier, from the stuffed
specimen preserved at Paris, made at my request under the inspection of Dr.
Leach, the appearance of the arms corresponds with the measurement given
in the Annales du Museum; the ends of the fingers do not reach to the
external ancle. This difference in the proportions of two animals, in which
it might be expected that distinction of species would be as much marked
by the proportion of parts, as by their form, seems almost sufficient, especially
in conjunction with the remarkable difference of structure in their toes, to
separate them distinctly from each other. As Tilesius has given nodimen* Histoire Naturelle, torn. xiii. This error is corrected in his supplement, torn. ix.  
  
  f Annales de Museum, torn. xvi. p. 46.
<!-- Leaf 431, Page: 369 -->
sions of his animal, I have been unable to compare them with those of
theOrang-Outang which I have described. His description of the general
characters of his animal certainly answers to those of the Orang-Outang
of Borneo; but the greater number of them belong also to the Simla
Troglodytes of Linnæus.


Another animal which resembles in most of its external characters the
Orang-Outang from Borneo, is the large monkey described by Wurmb, and
which he called the Pongo or large Orang-Outang. The skeleton of Wurmb's
animal is preserved in the Museum of Natural History of Paris, and has
been described and figured by Geoffroy*, who has endeavoured to prove that
it belongs rather to a non-descript genus closely allied to the Mandrils.
Tilesius t has, however, conjectured that it is the same animal as the
OrangOutang from the East Indies described by different writers, and that it only
differs from them in being full grown. In this opinion he has, according to a
notice contained in one of the late numbers of the Annals of Philosophy,
been followed by Cuvier, who supposes all the Orang-Outangs that have
reached Europe to have been the young animals of the species described by
Wurmb. Tilesius has stated no grounds for his conjecture; Cuvier's
dissertation, which was read on the 16th of February to the Academy of Sciences,
is not published. I would, however, with deference remark, that in
comparing Camper's description of the skeleton of the Orang-Outang of Borneo,
Avith the description and figure published by Geoffroy, important anatomical
distinctions may be observed. In Camper's figure of the skull of his
OrangOutang, those dimensions are most expanded which in Geoffroy's plates are
the reverse. In Camper's, the os frontis rises abruptly from the orbits, and
forms with the ossa parietalia an ample arch, giving to the upper part of
the cranium a spherical form. In Geoffroy's plate, the os frontis slopes
suddenly from above the orbits, and the cranium is flattened on the sides. In
Camper's the occipital foramen is nearer the centre of the cranium than in
Geoffroy's. In Camper's plate the spine articulates with the head at an
acute angle, and the first cervical vertebra allows the head no motion
backwards. In Geoffroy's plate the spine articulates with the head at

37q ORANG-OUTANG.

right angles, and the first cervical process is at so great a distance from
the cranium, as to allow the head extensive motion backwards. Such
are the differences which, according to the testimonies of Camper and
Geoffroy, exist between the skeletons of Wurmb's animal, and that of the
Orang-Outang of Borneo; and which, together with the absence of nails
on the great toes of the former, and their existence on those of the
latter, are surely sufficient, in the present state of our knowledge, to justify
their being considered as distinct animals.


I shall conclude these observations on the Orang-Outang of Borneo, by
quoting Camper's description of a peculiar appendage to the larynx of the
animal, which, as he gravely tells us, shows the fallacy of the opinion
which supposes Orang-Outangs will not speak, from their apprehension of
being made slaves by men : I have also added some of the anatomical
differences by which he distinguishes them from man.


\"In December, 1770> I dissected at Groningen, the Orang of M. Hoffman
with the greatest accuracy : removing the skin and the broad muscles of the
neck, I found the tongue-bone closely resembling that of the human species,
and pretty large for the size of the animal. Pursuing my dissection, I
discovered a large sack on the right side, running over the clavicular bones, and
another on the left side, but visibly smaller.


\"The large sack tore a little on account of its being tender, by having laid
so long in spirits: I inflated it through the opening, which I continued
quickly, as I perceived that the air went off betwixt the tongue-bone and
the thyroideus cartilage; I then followed up the rent with a pair of scissars,
and cut open the sack, by which means I discovered a transverse split. There
was now no doubt any longer, but that the left sack had a similar orifice.


\"In pursuance of it, I took away the whole soft palate and the æsophagus,
as far as below the speaking organs. The soft palate is the same as in most
quadrupeds, with this difference, nevertheless, that the uvula on the hind side
runs very evidently downwards, but not beneath the margin of the soft
palate, much less does the uvula descend as in the human species. This
palate appears, however, more capable than in other animals to be voluntarily
contracted.


\"Two such air-sacks were also found in the Orang sent me for investigation
by M. Vosmær, and again returned to him. The same were in the Orang
which I dissected at the house of M. Van Hoey, on the 31st August, 1774,
and were shewn to him and his son.
<!-- Leaf 433, Page: 371 -->

\"However, in the Orang presented to me by M. Hope there was some
difference : the tongue-bone was the same as in the two former, but there Avas
merely one single sack, having two air tubes, which united themselves with
the two splits.


\"In opening further the skin of the breast, and separating the broad muscles
of the neck, I saw one single sack, and inflated it through the throat of the
Orang, upon which it appeared, that it was indeed derived from two
membraneous tubes, as in the three former ones, but that the two sacks were
gone over into one: had this been produced by touching or pressing, or had
they been so from its birth ?


\"It was also plainly seen, that the part of the right side, being larger than
the left one, left behind a sort of partition, by the narrowing betwixt. If
air was introduced through the one or other opening at the side of the
epiglottis, the whole sack expanded equally; and if strongly blown into it,
the appendages became more considerably visible.


\"As soon as the trunk of the Orang-Outang was sent me from the Hague
by M. Vosmær, I examined the speaking organs, removed the flaps of the
tAvo latissimi colli, or broad muscles of the neck, very carefully, and
prepared every thing as well as I could, blowing from time to time through
the larynx, by which I perceived, that in this Orang both the sacks had
also gone over into one, but they were much larger than in the one just
described from M. Hope; the bottom ran nearly to the end of the breast bone,
and Avas partly covered by the breast muscles; the sack ran upwards above
the clavicular bones, and Avith the appendages still more backwards, so that
this sack penetrated on each side deep under the monk's-hood muscles, as
far as behind upon the shoulder-blades.


\"As the Orang gets older and taller, so extends this sack, probably by
degrees more and more, the same as we see in herbiverous animals, that,
when just brought forth, their fourth maw is larger than the paunch; and
on the contrary, that this latter, by means of the continual further
expansion in the eating of food, becomes again considerably larger than the
former: the air performs here the same, and the sack having expanded
more and more betwixt the just-now enumerated parts, obtains gradually
these manifold extensions, under the shape of appendages.

« When I brought the blow-pipe into the larynx, and shut the split, I blew
the lungs up first, and these being filled, the air immediately penetrated
into this large air-sack. It does not appear to me that the passing over into  
  
  
  3 b 2
<!-- Leaf 434, Page: 372 -->
one, or natural union of these two sacks, can occasion any detriment in the
use of it, because we see something similar taking place in the kidneys of
the human species, whose lower parts are not unfrequently united with each
other in such a manner as if they constituted but one, having hoAvever
separate blood-vessels, and each forming on that account a ureter, without
being able to see, from the skeleton of the body, that any obstacle has been
occasioned by it. I possess one of this kind in my collection of anatomical
preparations.


\"The Orang can, in the mean time, voluntarily swell up these sacks, or
this united sack, Avhenever it tries or attempts to press the strongly inhaled
air outwards, and presses then the epiglottis towards the opening of the
larynx, or bends it only a little. It can also empty them at pleasure, by
means of the broad muscles of the neck, by those of the breast, and by the
cucullares or monk's-hood muscles: the Rendeer, whose air-sacks do not
lie beneath these muscles, has received from nature two muscles, which
originating from the tongue-bone, spread out their fibres, and surround
the whole air-sack.


•' We conclude from this, that in the tailed monkeys, and in the Egyptian
monkey without tail, in which we have found a single air-sack towards the
throat, as well as in the Orangs, who naturally have two, although
sometimes gone over into one, the air, more or less, by means of the split formed
by the larynx, loses all its force to diffuse itself from its own accord in this
sack or sacks.


\"There is an apparent conformity betwixt these speaking organs and those
of the male frog, which likewise press the air the length of the tongue, into
tAvo bladders, situated sideways, and presses it out again with the known
sound, from the same openings below the tongue, by means of the muscles
of these bladders, as I have, I apprehend, demonstrated plainly in my treatise
on the croaking of frogs." *


The following marks of distinction between the Orang-Outang and man,
have already been transcribed from Camper, by Tilesius in the appendix to
Krusenstern's Voyage.


\"1. The upper jaw of the Orang-Outang does not stand perpendicularly
under the arch of the forehead, but makes an angle of fifty-eight degrees  
  
  
  Manuscript Translation of Camper's Treatise on the Orang-Outang of Borneo.
<!-- Leaf 435, Page: 373 -->
with tne facial line. It consists also of two bones, the upper maxillary, and
the intermaxillary, the latter of which is wanting in man.


\"2. The temporal bones are very small; and the cervical A'ertebræ have
long processes, which prevent the head from being carried backward in any
considerable degree.


\"3. The pelvis. The ischia are high, flat, and small, so as to form nearly
a flat surface with the ilia and sacrum; whence the cavity of the pelvis is
small. Hence too the cavity of the abdomen is smaller than that of the
thorax.


\"4. The spine. In the Orang-Outang it proceeds downward in a straight
line; in man on the contrary it has the figure of a Roman S.


\"5. The duodenum of the Orang-Outang has no rugæ. The liver and
gall bladder too are not like those osman.


\"6. Its proportions. The head is a sixth part of its whole length, in man
it is only an eighth.


\"7. Length of the arms. It fathoms with these eight lengths of the head,
consequently two more than its OAvn height: a man fathoms exactly his own
height.


\"8. Length of the hands. Its hand is equal to a ninth part of its height,
and is consequently longer in proportion than its head; in man the hand is
the length of the face.  
  
  
  " 9- The feet. These are about a fifth of its height; those osman are a sixth.


\"10. The thorax. This is slender and deep, whence it cannot lie on the
back."


The tenth observation does not apply to the animal that I have described,
as he frequently lies on his back; some of the others are objectionable,
because the animals from which the proportions were taken had not reached
their full growth.  
  
  
  
Tilesius has mentioned, on the authority of Camper, the existence ofthirteen ribs amongst the characteristic marks of the Orang-Outang of Borneo,
but in doing so appears to have fallen into an important error. In
consulting Camper I find that he distinctly states, that the skeleton of his
OrangOutang had Only twelve ribs. " In het geraante van den Orang-Outang
bevonden zig zes waare dat is met het borst-been vercenigde ribben, en
zes omvarre."*—" In the skeleton of the Orang-Outang there Avere foundsix
true ribs, i. e. inserted in the sternum, and six false ones."

  The Emperor of China's Beply to the Beport made to Court by the Viceroy  
  
  
  of Canton, respecting the Embassy from His Boyal Highness the Prince  
  
  
  Begent.

On the 29th of the 5th moon of the 21st year of Kea-king, (24th June,
1816) the following high decree was received (at Peking) with profound
respect:


Tung, the Foo-yuen, and acting Viceroy of Canton, and other officers of
rank in the province, have forwarded to Court a dispatch, announcing an
Embassy with presents (the original word is often translated tribute) from
England. As the English nation offers presents, and tenders its sincere
good will with feelings, and in language respectful and complaisant, it
is doubtless proper to allow the Embassy and presents to enter China, and
the ship bearing them to proceed to Teen-sing, that the Ambassador and
suite may disembark.


Imperial orders have already been issued to the Viceroy of Pe-tche-le
(Nayen-ching) to arrange all affairs on the present occasion, in a liberal,
gracious, and suitable manner.


The above-mentioned Foo-yuen and acting Viceroy, with his colleagues,
being apprehensive that at the port of Teen-sin, and other places on
the coast, there are no persons well acquainted with the manners of
foreigners, propose to enjoin the Hong merchants to select and appoint two
men who understand the foreign character, that one may be sent to the
province of Pe-tche-le, and the other to Che-keang, to wait there at the palaces
of the Viceroy and Foo-yuen, to be ready to translate when required. This
arrangement is extremely good.


As to the foreign officer, (Captain Clavel) sent by the King of England,
now at Canton, let the Viceroy say to him, " I have reported to the Great
<!-- Leaf 451 -->
  
  CHINESE OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS. 3gl

Emperor the intention of your King, to send presents to manifest his sincere
good will; and have now to return thanks (to my Sovereign) for his
consenting that the Ambassador from England should proceed to Court where
he will assuredly be received and presented with gifts."


The foreign officer above-mentioned, may, agreeably to our regulations,
return home.


Let this decree be made known by a Woo-lu, (an express travelling at
about one hundred English miles a day.)

Ho-she-tae has stated to His Majesty, that the English tribute-bearer is
daily practising the ceremony, and manifests the highest possible respect and
veneration.


The said nation, separated by a vast ocean, offers up a sincere tributeof
profound respect and veneration. Tribute was first sent in the 58th year of
Kien-lung; and now prostrate she sends an Ambassador to Court to offer
presents, with respect worthy of high commendation.


To-day* Ho-she-tae, and Moo-kih-tang-yih, have brought the Ambassadors
to the house at Hay-teen.


It is ordered, that on the 7th (29th August) he be admitted to an

  Extract from the Peking Gazette of the 15th Day of the 7 th Moon of the 2lst  
  
  
  Year of Kea-ldng, (4<th September, 1816.)  
  
  
  imperial edict.


Upon the present occasion of the English nation sending envoys with
tribute, (valuable offerings,) as they could not, when at Teen-sin, return
thanks for the feast, agreeably to the regulated form, the conducting them
ao*ain to their boats, for the purpose of proceeding further north, was the
fault of Soo-lin-yih and Kwang-hwae.

When they were at Tung-chow, and had not yet practised the ceremony,
the forming a confused and indistinct report, and then conducting them at
once to Court, was the fault of Ho-she-tae, and Moo-kih-ting-yih.

Lastly, on the 7th day (29th August), I, the Emperor, issue my orders;
and having ascended into the Imperial Hall, and called the envoys to an
audience • but the Envoy and suite had travelled from Tung-chow all night,
footnote:[Possible signature: "3d"]
<!-- Leaf 456, Page: 386 -->
and had come direct to the Palace gate without stopping by the way at their
appointed residence, and their dresses of ceremony not having arrived, they
could not present themselves before me: If at that time Ho-she-tae had
addressed to me a true report, I, the Emperor, would certainly have issued
my commands, and have changed the period of the audience, in order to
correspond with their intentions, in thus coming ten thousand miles to my
Court. On the contrary, he addressed to me repeated reports, expressed in
disrespectful language, in consequence of which the Envoys were sent back,
and the ceremonial not completed. The error and mismanagement of
Hoshe-tae in this affair is a fault really inexcusable.


But the arrangements for the business of the day were already made,
excepting the minister Fo-tsin, who was absent from illness, and Tong-kao and
Lea-yin-po, whose attendance had not been required. All the assisting Princes,
Dukes, and great officers of the palace, were in waiting in the anti-chamber.
Many of them must have been eye-witnesses of the whole affair, and must have
known in their hearts that it was their duty to have made a true report of it
to me, and to have solicited me to alter the period of the audience; yet they
sat immovable while the affair was thus going wrong; though Ho-she-tae
was visibly alarmed, and in error, no one stood forward to set him right.


Afterwards when the Imperial audience took place, some persons who
knew the truth disclosed Ho-she-tae's errors and irresolutions; but why did
they not address me at the time in his stead ? — or if they dared not go that
length, why did they not at least awaken Ho-she-tae, and cause him to
report the truth ? Thus it is that their countenances are indeed always placid
and composed, but when public business occurs they sit unmoved, and see
the failure with indifference. Such conduct, whenever placed in any situation
of hazard or difficulty, one cannot behold without sighing deeply.


The affair in which Ho-she-tae has erred is itself a very small one, yet
even in this the officers of the court have been destitute of any expedient for
the service of their country. For the future let them eradicate all selfish
principles, whenever there is any defect of fidelity or public spirit, let no one
plead that it is an affair which does not individually concern him. Let all look
up, and diligently regulate their conduct according to the true spirit of the
admonitions I have repeatedly given them.  
  
  
  Bespect this.

Edict addressed to the Viceroy of Canton, dated the 15th Day of the 7th Moon

of the 9.1st Year of Kea-king, (6th September, 1816,) addressed to the

Viceroy, Kiang, and Foyuen, Tung of Canton, and received the 5th of the

8th Moon (25th September).


The English Ambassadors, upon their arrival at Teen-sing, have not
observed the laws of politeness, in return for the invitation of the Emperor. —
At Tung-chow (four leagues from the Court) they gave assurances of
readiness to perform the prostration and genuflexion required by the laws of good
manners (of the country); and arrived at the imperial country house (half
a league from court), and when we were on the point of repairing to the Hall
(to receive the embassy), the first, as well as the second Ambassador, under
pretence of ill health, would not appear. We, in consequence, passed a
decree that they should be sent away upon their return. We, however,
reflecting, that although the said Ambassadors were blamable in not observing the
laws of politeness, towards the Sovereign of their country who, from an
immense distance, and over various seas, had sent to offer us presents, and to
present with respect his letters, indicating a wish to show us due
consideration and obedience, contempt was improper, and against the maxim to show
lenity to our inferiors; in consequence, from amongst the presents of the said
King, we chose the most trifling and insignificant, which are four maps,
two portraits, ninety-five engravings; and, in order to gratify him, have
accepted them. We, in return, as a reward, presented to the said King a
yuyu, a string of rare stones, two pairs of large purses, and four pairs of small
ones; and we order the Ambassadors to receive these gifts, and to return
to their kingdom, having so enacted in observance of the maxim of
Confucius, " Give much, receive little."


When the Ambassadors received the said gifts, they became exceeding
glad, and evinced their repentance. They have already quitted Tung-chow;
upon their arrival at Canton, you, Kiang and Tung, will invite them to
dinner, in compliance with good manners, and will make the following speech
to them : —


* Your good fortune has been small; you arrived at the gates of the
imperial house, and were unable to lift your eyes to the face of Heaven (the
Emperor).  
  
  
  3d 2
<!-- Leaf 458, Page: 388 -->

\"The Great Emperor reflected that your King sighed after happiness
(China), and acted with sincerity; we therefore accepted some presents, and
gifted your King with various precious articles. You must return thanks to
the Emperor for his benefits, and return with speed to your kingdom, that
your King may feel a respectful gratitude for these acts of kindness. Take
care to embark the rest of the presents with safety, that they may not be lost
or destroyed."


After this lecture, should the Ambassador supplicate you to receive the
remainder of the presents, answer, in one word, " A decree has passed, we
therefore dare not present troublesome petitions," and, with decision, rid
yourselves of them.  
  
  
  Bespect this.

Imperial Edict, respecting the Embassy, received privately from General Wang,
at Kwa-chow, 18th October, 1816.


His Majesty's pleasure, as follows, has been received with feelings of
respect:—


On the day that the English Ambassador came to the gate of the Palace,
he said he was sick, and could not attend the imperial residence. It was
afterwards discovered, on an investigation being made, that the said
Ambassador had travelled during the night from Tung-chow to Pekin, and when he
reached the gate of the Palace, the court-dresses which they brought
were still on the road, and that he dared not perform the ceremony in his
ordinary clothes, and therefore sickness was affirmed. Ho-she-tae did not
report clearly the fact, that the time appointed for the audience might be
changed, and the ceremony performed. That was an error committed by
Ho-she-tae in a direct address to me, which led to sending back the Embassy
on the same day.


I, on reconsidering that the said nation had sent a tribute of sincere and
entire devotedness from beyond a vast ocean, at the distance of thousands
of miles, (original, ten thousand lees,) could not bear to reject their
<!-- Leaf 459, Page: 389 -->
expressions of veneration and obedience. Hence I again sent down my
pleasure, requiring that the most trifling (viz. the very lightest) of the articles of
tribute should be presented, and the kindness conferred of receiving them.
They are maps, painted likenesses, and prints; three articles. At the same
time, I conferred on the King of their country a white precious stone joo-ee,
sapphire court beads, and different sized purses, to manifest the idea of
\"giving much, and receiving little." The Ambassador received them at
Tung-chow with extreme joy and gratitude; and also, rather by his manner,
contrition and fear.


Of late, within the limits of Che-le (or province of Pekin), he has walked
about, or travelled about (or travelled) very peaceably and quietly; hereafter
when he shall enter the limits of the Kiang (province of Kiang-nan), let the
Viceroy enjoin all the officers who conduct the embassy, still to behave with
the civilities due to an Ambassador. They must not allow themselves to
behave with insult or contempt.


The Ambassador will, in a few days, arrive at the boundaries of the Kiang.
The three provinces Keang-soo, Gan-whay, and Keang-see, are under the
control of the appropriate Viceroy. Let that Viceroy communicate
information respecting this to the several fooyuens of those provinces. When the
embassy enters the limits of the province, let him select civil and military
officers, who may take under their command soldiers, and police runners, to
conduct safely the embassy.


Do not cause the persons of the embassy to land to make disturbance.
Through the whole of the route, let the military be all caused to have their
armour fresh and shining, and their weapons disposed in a commanding
style, to maintain an attitude formidable and dignified (or majestic).


The said embassy (original, nation) came with the intention of offering
tribute; still treat it with civility, and silently cause it to feel gratitude and
awe; then the right principles of soothing and controlling will be acted on.

Paper respecting the Embassy, drawn up by the Emperor, explaining his
Conduct to the Embassy.


A vermillion edict (*?. e. a paper written by the Emperor's own hand) has
been respectfully received, and is as follows : —
<!-- Leaf 460, Page: 390 -->

On this occasion the English Ambassador sent to convey tribute, landed
at the mouth of the river leading to Teen-sin. It was specially ordered that
Loo-king-gih and Kwang-hwae should communicate authoritatively the
imperial pleasure, that a banquet should be conferred and he the Ambassador
be ordered to return thanks for the banquet by performing the ceremony of
three kneelings, and nine knocks of the head upon the ground. — If it were
performed according to the prescribed rule, then to bring the embassy to
Pekin the same day, if the Ambassador did not know how to perform the
ceremony, then to report to the Emperor and wait his pleasure.


Their ships are not to be caused to depart; they were to return from
Teensin by the way they came, and to return to their country by sea.
Soo-linggih and Kwang-hwae purposely acted contrary to the Imperial pleasure, and
brought onward the embassy, and they connived at the ships going away in
a clandestine manner.


Because the affair was not yet settled, Ho-she-tae, and Moo-kih-tun were
ordered to go and meet the embassy at Tung-chow, and there exercise them
in the ceremony. To the 6th day of the 7th moon (28th August) was the
period limited. If within that period they performed the ceremony, then to
bring them forward immediately; if when the time was elapsed they had
still not observed the proper forms, then to report to the Emperor and wait
his pleasure.


On the 5th Ho-she-tae, and Moo-kih-tang-gih, sent a confused obscure
report, and on the 6th brought forward the embassy.


I, the Emperor, at half-past one o'clock descended to the King-ching-teen
(Hall of Diligent Governance), and called these two men to an interview to
interrogate them respecting the performance of the ceremony. These two
pulled off their caps, and dashed their heads against the ground, saying the
ceremony had not yet been practised. When they were again asked, " Since
the ceremony was not performed, why did not you report ?" Ho-she-tae
said, " To-morrow morning, when they enter to see Your Majesty, they
must be able to perform agreeably to the proper form." In this the fault of
these two men wTas the same as, or equal to, those who preceded them.


On the morning of the 7th, after breakfast, at half-past five o'clock, I, the
Emperor, dictated my pleasure, that I would ascend the Hall, and call the
Ambassador to an audience. Ho-she-tae, the first time, reported to me that
the Ambassador could not travel fast; when he arrived at the gate my
pleasure should be again requested. The next time he reported that the
<!-- Leaf 461, Page: 391 -->
principal Ambassador was ill, a short delay was necessary. The third time he
reported, the principal Ambassador was so ill, he could not come to an
interview. I then ordered that the principal Ambassador should go to his
lodgings, and a physician be conferred upon him to effect his cure. I then
ordered the assistant ambassador to enter to an interview the fourth time. He
reported that the assistant ambassadors were both sick; that it must be
deferred till the principal Ambassador was recovered, and then they would
come together to an interview.


Chung-kwo (China, the central nation) is the sovereign of the whole
world. For what reason should contumely and arrogance like this be
endured with quiet temper ? I therefore sent down my pleasure to expel those
Ambassadors, and send them back to their own country, without punishing
the high crime they had committed.


As before, Soo-lin-gih and Kwang-hwae were ordered to escort them to
Canton, on board their ships.


Within these few days, having called my courtiers together to an
interview, I began to find out, that the Ambassador had travelled from
Tungchow directly to a room of the Palace, and that he had been on the road all
night. He said, " The court dresses, in which to enter and see majesty,
are yet behind; they have not come up yet; how can I, in my ordinary
garments, lift up my eyes to the Great Emperor ?"


Why did not Ho-she-tae, when he saw me, state these circumstances ? or
if he forgot, why did he not, during the evening, add to what he had before
reported ? Or the next day state it early ? All these ways he might have
taken; but to the last moment, when I was about to ascend the Hall of
Audience, he never stated clearly these circumstances. The crime of these
two men (Ho and Moo) is heavier than that of Soo-lin-gih. Had they
previously stated matters clearly to me, I must have changed the time for
calling the Ambassador to an interview, and for his completing the ceremony.
I never supposed that a stupid statesman would injure affairs to this extent.
I, the Emperor, have really not the face (am ashamed) to appear before the
ministers beneath me, who are labourers for the state. It only remains for
me to take blame to myself.


As for the crime of these four men, when the board has deliberated and
sent up their opinion, I shall decide.  
  
  
  Take this Imperial Declaration, and proclaim it fully to those within
<!-- Leaf 462, Page: 392 -->
China and beyond it. Let the Mung-koo, Kings, Dukes, and so forth,
know it.  
  
  
  Bespect this.

Translation ofa Paper issued in the Form of a Proclamation, addressed to

native Chinese at Ta-tung, in the Province of Gan-whay, respecting the

British Embassy.


On the 4th of the 9th moon (Oct. 24.), a letter was received from the
Seun-taou (a civil officer), on opening which it reads as follows :


On the 29th of the 8th moon (Oct. 19.), a document was received from the
Chin-taou, saying,


On the 23d of the 7th moon (Sept. 14th), was received with due respect
a communication from the noble viceroy Pe, on opening which it appears
as follows:


The English Tribute-bearer is returning to his country through the
interior (of China) by water. Kwang, the salt commissioner at Teen-sin, is
appointed by imperial authority to take the oversight and management (of the
Embassy) through the whole of the journey. It is also appointed that the
Treasurer, Judge, and Major-general of each province be on the boundary
of the province, to receive, escort, watch, and restrain (the persons of the
Embassy).


When the boats bring up at any landing-place, or a change of boats takes
place, let there be a numerous party of police runners appointed, and
required to clothe themselves in the jackets bearing the badge of their office :
let them join with the military to prevent the populace from coming to gaze,
and thereby cause a crowd and clamorous noise: let there be a special
oversight and restraint kept up to prevent the loss of any thing. The
populace on each bank of the river are not allowed to laugh and talk with the
foreigners; nor are women and girls allowed to show their faces.


Further, foreign envoys coming to China are by law prohibited from
purchasing books or other articles.


On this occasion the envoys bearing tribute, travelling by water to the
south, are not allowed, any one of them, to land at the places which they
<!-- Leaf 463, Page: 393 -->
pass, nor are they allowed privately (or clandestinely) to make purchases of
any commodities. On every occasion let care be taken to prevent. If any
of the boatmen dare to purchase for them any books, victuals, or other
necessaries, they shall be immediately seized and severely punished.


The above coming before me, the Heen, it is incumbent upon me to issue
a Proclamation to make subject fully known to the military people. When
the Tribute Envoys' boats come to any place, you people are not allowed
to gaze and look, so as thereby to cause a crowd and clamorous noise; nor
are you allowed to talk with the foreign Envoys. It is still more necessary
that women and girls should retire; they are not allowed to expose their
faces, nor go out and look about them: if any dare wilfully to disobey this,
they shall be instantly seized and punished. Decidedly no indulgence shall
be shown.

  (NOVEMBER 13. 1814.)  
  
  
  " ON GOVERNING WITH SINCERITY.  
  
  
  DRAWN UP BY HIS MAJESTY.


\"Govern with truth and sincerity, and order will be the result; if not,
then anarchy will ensue. To an individual, a family, even to the Sovereign
and the whole Empire, nothing further is requisite than truth.

\"At this moment great degeneracy prevails; the Magistrates are
destitute of truth, and great numbers of the people are false and deceitful. The
Magistrates are remiss and inattentive; the People are all given up to
visionary schemes and infernal arts. The link that binds together superiors
and inferiors is broken. There is little of either conscience or a sense of
shame. Not only do they neglect to obey the admonitions which I give
them; but, even with respect to those traitorous banditti, who make the
most horrible opposition to me; it affects not their minds in the least degree;
they never give the subject a thought. It is indeed monstrously strange!
That which weighs with them is their persons and families; the nation and
government, they consider light as nothing.
<!-- Leaf 464, Page: 394 -->

\"He who sincerely serves his country, leaves the fragrance of a good
name to a hundred ages; he who does not, leaves a name that stinks for tens
of thousands of years.


\"The utmost limit of man's life, is not more than an hundred years.
What hearts have those, who, being engaged in the service of their Sovereign,
but destitute of talent, yet choose to enjoy the sweets of office, and carelessly
spend their days !


\"The means used by the sages, to perfect their virtue, is expressed in one
word, " Sincerity." Sincerity ! or, in other words, Truth and Uprightness.
Let my servants (the officers of the Empire) examine themselves, whether or
not they can be sincere; whether or not they can be upright ? I fear they
will give but a poor account.


\"The virtue of the common People, is like the waving grain, (it bends
with every wind that blows). If superiors have little truth or sincerity in
their hearts, the disorderly intentions of the People will certainly be numerous.
Small in the beginning, and not affecting the mass of the People, they
gradually increase, till at last the bludgeon is seized, and rebellion and anarchy
ensue.


\"In ancient times, the heads of rebellion, styled themselves Wang and
Te, Kings and Emperors *; but it was never heard in ancient times, that
any assumed the name of San hwang, (or the King of Heaven, the King of
Earth, and the King of Men +). The hearts of the men of this age are daily
degenerating.


\"As we are the Superiors of this People, shall we bear not to exert our
hearts and strength to the utmost?—shall we not bend under the labour even
to lassitude, if we may thereby save a ten-thousandth part?


\"If in coming forward, or in retiring, the sole object be personal gain;
does a man not lower himself thereby to the common mass; nay, sink low as
the filth of the age ? Think, what kind of men will future ages describe you !
Will they not engrave infamy on your back ?


\"For every portion of sincerity exerted by the officers of Government,
the Nation receives a portion of felicity, and the People are spared a portion
of misery. The Prince and the People alike depend on the officers of  
  
  
  * By this it would appear, that some person had recently assumed this title.
f Alluding to the fabulous ages of Chinese History.
<!-- Leaf 465, Page: 395 -->
Government. The happy state of things in the time of Tang and Yu * was
the result of the exertions of the officers of Government.


\"Because of my moral defects, I met with the great convulsion which
took place the last year. Day nor night can I banish it from my breast.
My anxious and constant desire is, to brings things to a well governed state.
How shall I dare to be remiss or inattentive to it ? But my servants, of late,
gradually forget the affair. When I call them into my presence, they say,
\"There is nothing wrong!"


\"O, alas ! — The residue of the rebels not yet taken; commotion excited
by various reports; to sit down with repose is impracticable. Shall men
still treat it with indifference, and allow themselves to say, ' There is
nothing wrong!' If this may be endured, what may not be endured ?


\"I speak with the utmost sincerity of heart, and call upon all the officers
of my Court to act with sincerity of heart, and sincerely fulfil the duty of
good servants. Thus they will aid my sincere wishes, and accord with my
sincere declarations. — If you are able to disregard this, and consider the
words of your Sovereign as of no importance, your are indeed harder than
the rocks. You are unfit to be spoken to; and the fault of speaking to
those who are unfit to be spoken to, devolves on me. But, it will be
impossible for you to escape being charged by the pen of the Historian, as false
and treacherous deceivers. The distinction betwixt a Patriot and a Traitor
is expressed by the two words ' True, False.' In the morning and at night,
lay your hands upon your hearts, and you will understand without the aid of
words."


The following document shows how assiduous the Tartars are to preserve
the distinction betwixt themselves and the Chinese : —  
  
  
  « PEKING GAZETTE.  
  
  
  " The following Imperial Edict has been respectfully received.


« In consequence of some of the Imperial Family taking the names
Hokwan-paou, and Tsing-yung-tae, I sent down an order requiring them to be
changed.  
  
  
  " Yesterday, Yung-see, my Royal Cousin, stated verbally, that a great  
  
  
  * About the year of the world 1700.  
  
  
  3e 2
<!-- Leaf 466, Page: 396 -->
many of the Imperial kindred had taken names, containing three characters,
and which did not form a Tartar word. He requested that all such should be
ordered to change their names. His request is by no means proper. Those
under the Tartar Banners, adopting a Chinese name, are not permitted to
take three characters.* This is with the intention that they may be
distinguished from Chinese names.


\"The Sons of the Eight Banners take Tartar names, in which three or
four characters are used, and from the change of the termination of a word,
they do not well agree with the Tartar language. Of this class, it is difficult
to ascertain the number. If they be ordered to change, it will occasion
much trouble and confusion and be unsuitable to the dignity of
Government.


\"It is ordered, that in all these case they act as heretofore. It is unne
cessary to deliberate upon it.  
  
  
  " Bespect this."  
  
  
  * There are generally three characters in Chinese names.
